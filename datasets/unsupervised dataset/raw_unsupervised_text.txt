Depression
and
anxiety
are
different
conditions,
but
they
commonly
occur
together.
They
also
have
similar
treatments.
Feeling
down
or
having
the
blues
now
and
then
is
normal.
And
everyone
feels
anxious
from
time
to
time
—
it's
a
normal
response
to
stressful
situations.
But
severe
or
ongoing
feelings
of
depression
and
anxiety
can
be
a
sign
of
an
underlying
mental
health
disorder.
%
Anxiety
may
occur
as
a
symptom
of
clinical
(major)
depression.
It's
also
common
to
have
depression
that's
triggered
by
an
anxiety
disorder,
such
as
generalized
anxiety
disorder,
panic
disorder
or
separation
anxiety
disorder.
Many
people
have
a
diagnosis
of
both
an
anxiety
disorder
and
clinical
depression
Symptoms
of
both
conditions
usually
improve
with
psychological
counseling
(psychotherapy),
medications,
such
as
antidepressants,
or
both.
Lifestyle
changes,
such
as
improving
sleep
habits,
increasing
social
support,
using
stress-reduction
techniques
or
getting
regular
exercise,
also
may
help.
If
you
have
either
condition,
avoid
alcohol,
smoking
and
recreational
drugs.
They
can
make
both
conditions
worse
and
interfere
with
treatment.
%
Do
you
feel
irritable,
isolated
or
withdrawn?
Do
you
find
yourself
working
all
the
time?
Drinking
too
much?
These
unhealthy
coping
strategies
may
be
clues
that
you
have
male
depression.
Depression
can
affect
men
and
women
differently.
When
depression
occurs
in
men,
it
may
be
masked
by
unhealthy
coping
behavior.
For
a
number
of
reasons,
male
depression
often
goes
undiagnosed
and
can
have
devastating
consequences
when
it
goes
untreated.
But
male
depression
usually
gets
better
with
treatment.
%
Depression
signs
and
symptoms
can
differ
in
men
and
women.
Men
also
tend
to
use
different
coping
skills
—
both
healthy
and
unhealthy
—
than
women
do.
It
isn't
clear
why
men
and
women
may
experience
depression
differently.
It
likely
involves
a
number
of
factors,
including
brain
chemistry,
hormones
and
life
experiences.
Like
women
with
depression,
men
with
depression
may:
●
Feel
sad,
hopeless
or
empty
●
Feel
extremely
tired
●
Have
difficulty
sleeping
or
sleep
too
much
●
Not
get
pleasure
from
activities
usually
enjoyed
%Other
behaviors
in
men
that
could
be
signs
of
depression
—
but
not
recognized
as
such
—
include:
●
Escapist
behavior,
such
as
spending
a
lot
of
time
at
work
or
on
sports
●
Physical
symptoms,
such
as
headaches,
digestive
problems
and
pain
●
Problems
with
alcohol
or
drug
use
●
Controlling,
violent
or
abusive
behavior
●
Irritability
or
inappropriate
anger
●
Risky
behavior,
such
as
reckless
driving
Because
these
behaviors
could
be
signs
of
or
might
overlap
with
other
mental
health
issues,
or
may
be
associated
with
medical
conditions,
professional
help
is
the
key
to
an
accurate
diagnosis
and
appropriate
treatment.
%
●
Failure
to
recognize
depression.
You
may
think
that
feeling
sad
or
emotional
is
always
the
main
symptom
of
depression.
But
for
many
men,
that
isn't
the
primary
symptom.
For
example,
headaches,
digestive
problems,
tiredness,
irritability
or
long-term
pain
can
sometimes
indicate
depression.
So
can
feeling
isolated
and
seeking
distraction
to
avoid
dealing
with
feelings
or
relationships.
%
●
Downplaying
signs
and
symptoms.
You
may
not
recognize
how
much
your
symptoms
affect
you,
or
you
may
not
want
to
admit
to
yourself
or
to
anyone
else
that
you're
depressed.
But
ignoring,
suppressing
or
masking
depression
with
unhealthy
behavior
will
only
worsen
the
negative
emotions.
%
●
Reluctance
to
discuss
depression
symptoms.
You
may
not
be
open
to
talking
about
your
feelings
with
family
or
friends,
let
alone
with
a
doctor
or
mental
health
professional.
Like
many
men,
you
may
have
learned
to
emphasize
self-control.
You
may
think
it's
not
manly
to
express
feelings
and
emotions
associated
with
depression,
and
you
try
to
suppress
them.
%
●
Resisting
mental
health
treatment.
Even
if
you
suspect
you
have
depression,
you
may
avoid
diagnosis
or
refuse
treatment.
You
may
avoid
getting
help
because
you're
worried
that
the
stigma
of
depression
could
damage
your
career
or
cause
family
and
friends
to
lose
respect
for
you.
%Although
women
attempt
suicide
more
often
than
men
do,
men
are
more
likely
to
complete
suicide.
That's
because
men:
●
Use
methods
that
are
more
likely
to
cause
death,
such
as
guns
●
May
act
more
impulsively
on
suicidal
thoughts
●
Show
fewer
warning
signs,
such
as
talking
about
suicide

The
term
"nervous
breakdown"
is
used
by
some
people
to
describe
a
stressful
situation
when
life's
demands
become
physically
and
emotionally
overwhelming.
It
affects
a
person's
ability
to
meet
their
own
needs
and
do
daily
tasks
and
activities.
The
term
was
often
used
in
the
past,
but
mental
health
professionals
no
longer
use
it.
Instead,
you
may
hear
the
term
"mental
health
crisis."
%
Nervous
breakdown
isn't
a
medical
term.
What
some
people
call
a
nervous
breakdown
may
indicate
a
mental
health
problem
that's
causing
a
mental
health
crisis
and
needs
attention.
Two
examples
are
depression
and
anxiety,
which
can
be
treated
by
medicines,
talk
therapy,
also
called
psychotherapy,
or
both.
%
Signs
of
a
nervous
breakdown
vary
from
person
to
person
and
culture
to
culture.
Generally,
a
nervous
breakdown
means
that
a
person
can't
function
as
usual.
For
example,
a
person
may:
●
Call
in
sick
to
work
for
days
or
longer.
●
Avoid
social
events
and
miss
appointments.
●
Have
trouble
eating,
sleeping
or
staying
clean.
●
Talk
about
feeling
completely
hopeless
or
helpless.
Other
unusual
or
problematic
behaviors
may
be
symptoms
of
a
nervous
breakdown.
%
Pain
and
depression
are
closely
related.
Depression
can
cause
pain
—
and
pain
can
cause
depression.
Sometimes
pain
and
depression
create
a
vicious
cycle
in
which
pain
worsens
symptoms
of
depression,
and
then
the
resulting
depression
worsens
feelings
of
pain.
In
many
people,
depression
causes
unexplained
physical
symptoms
such
as
back
pain
or
headaches.
This
kind
of
pain
may
be
the
first
or
the
only
sign
of
depression.
%Pain
and
the
problems
it
causes
can
wear
you
down
over
time
and
affect
your
mood.
Chronic
pain
causes
a
number
of
problems
that
can
lead
to
depression,
such
as
trouble
sleeping
and
stress.
Disabling
pain
can
cause
low
self-esteem
due
to
work
or
financial
issues
or
the
inability
to
participate
in
social
activities
and
hobbies.
%
Depression
doesn't
just
occur
with
pain
resulting
from
an
injury.
It's
also
common
in
people
who
have
pain
linked
to
a
health
condition
such
as
diabetes,
cancer
or
heart
disease.
%
The
birth
of
a
baby
can
start
a
variety
of
powerful
emotions,
from
excitement
and
joy
to
fear
and
anxiety.
But
it
can
also
result
in
something
you
might
not
expect
—
depression.
Most
new
moms
experience
postpartum
"baby
blues"
after
childbirth,
which
commonly
include
mood
swings,
crying
spells,
anxiety
and
difficulty
sleeping.
Baby
blues
usually
begin
within
the
first
2
to
3
days
after
delivery
and
may
last
for
up
to
two
weeks.
%
But
some
new
moms
experience
a
more
severe,
long-lasting
form
of
depression
known
as
postpartum
depression.
Sometimes
it's
called
peripartum
depression
because
it
can
start
during
pregnancy
and
continue
after
childbirth.
Rarely,
an
extreme
mood
disorder
called
postpartum
psychosis
also
may
develop
after
childbirth.
%
Postpartum
depression
is
not
a
character
flaw
or
a
weakness.
Sometimes
it's
simply
a
complication
of
giving
birth.
If
you
have
postpartum
depression,
prompt
treatment

help
you
manage
your
symptoms

help
you

normal
to
have
feelings

to
when
symptoms

condition,
including
depression,
become
worse
in
the
weeks
or
days
leading
up
to
your
period.
Depression
is
one
of
the
most
common
conditions
thatcoexists
with
PMS.
About
half
of
all
women
who
get
treated
for
PMS
also
have
either
depression
or
anxiety.
%
Experts
aren’t
sure
about
the
exact
cause
of
PMS,
but
it’s
likely
linked
to
hormonal
fluctuations
that
happen
during
the
second
half
of
the
menstrual
cycle.
Ovulation
happens
about
halfway
through
your
cycle.
During
this
time,
your
body
releases
an
egg,
causing
estrogen
and
progesterone
levels
to
drop.
A
shift
in
these
hormones
can
cause
both
physical
and
emotional
symptoms.
%
Changes
in
estrogen
and
progesterone
levels
also
influence
serotonin
levels.
This
is
a
neurotransmitter
that
helps
regulate
your
mood,
sleep
cycle,
and
appetite.
Low
levels
of
serotonin
are
linked
to
feelings
of
sadness
and
irritability,
in
addition
to
trouble
sleeping
and
unusual
food
cravings
—
all
common
PMS
symptoms.
Your
symptoms
should
improve
when
estrogen
and

levels
rise

hormonal
birth
control

worse.
If

Premenstrual
dysphoric
disorder
(PMDD)
is
a
severe,
sometimes
disabling
extension
of
premenstrual
syndrome
(PMS).
Although
PMS
and
PMDD
both
have
physical
and
emotional
symptoms,
PMDD
causes
extreme
mood
shifts
that
can
disrupt
daily
life
and
damage
relationships.%
In
both
PMDD
and
PMS,
symptoms
usually
begin
seven
to
10
days
before
your
period
starts
and
continue
for
the
first
few
days
of
your
period.
Both
PMDD
and
PMS
may
cause
bloating,
breast
tenderness,
fatigue,
and
changes
in
sleep
and
eating
habits.
In

however,
at

one
of
these

symptoms
stands
out:
●
Sadness

hopelessness
●
Anxiety
or
tension
●
Extreme
moodiness
●
Marked
irritability
or
anger
%
The
cause
of
PMDD
isn't
clear.
Underlying
depression
and
anxiety
are
common
in
both
PMS
and
PMDD,
so
it's
possible
that
the
hormonal
changes
that
trigger
a
menstrual
period
worsen
the
symptoms
of
mood
disorders.
Feeling
depressed
before
and
during
a
menstrual
period
is
common.
Experts
believe
that
these
emotional
changes
occur
as
a
result
of
fluctuating
hormone
levels.
%
Low
levels
of
serotonin
and
dopamine
can
cause
sadness
and
anxiety.
Hormonal
changes
during
the
second
half
of
the
menstrual
cycle,
called
the
luteal
phase,
may
cause
a
low
mood
and
irritability
in
some
people.
After
ovulation
,
which
occurs
midcycle,
the
levels
of
the
female
sex
hormones
estrogen
and
progesterone
begin
to
fall.Rising
and
falling
levels
of
these
hormones
can
affect
brain
chemicals
called
neurotransmitters.
%
Examples
of
these
neurotransmitters
are
serotonin
and
dopamine,
which
are
both
chemicals
that
influence
mood,
sleep,
and
motivation.
Low
levels
of
serotonin
and
dopamine
can
cause:
●
sadness
●
anxiety
●
irritability
●
sleep
problems
●
food
cravings
All
of
these
are
common
symptoms

When
the
levels

estrogen
and
progesterone
begin
to
rise
again
a
few
days
after
the
onset
of
a
period,
these
symptoms
often
go
away.
Despite
the
connection
between
neurotransmitters
and
sex
hormones,
it
is
still
unclear
why
some
people
develop
PMS
or
PMDD
when
others
do
not.
%
levels
of
progesterone
and
estrogen
are
similar
between
people
who

experts
speculate
that
genetic
differences
may

Defining
sadness
and
depression

Sadness
is
a
normal
human
emotion
that
every

person
will
experience
at
stressful

somber
times.A
number

life
events
can
leave
people
feeling
sad
or
unhappy.

loss
or
absence
of
a
loved
one,
divorce,
loss
of
job
or
income,
financial
trouble,
or
issues
at
home
can
all
affect
mood
in
a
negative
way.
Failing
an
exam,
not
getting
a
job,
or
experiencing
other
disappointing
events
can
also
trigger
sadness.
However,
a
person
experiencing
sadness
can
usually
find
some
relief
from
crying,
venting,
or
talking
out
frustrations.
More
often
than
not,
sadness
has
links
to
a
specific
trigger.

usually
passes
with
time.

it
does
not
pass,
or
if
the
person
becomes
unable
to
resume
normal
function,
this
could
be
a
sign

should
talk

There are several forms of depressive disorders. The most 
common are major depressive disorder and dysthymic 
disorder.
Major depressive disorder,  also called major depression, 
is characterized by a combination of symptoms that inter -
fere with a person’s ability to work, sleep, study, eat, and 
enjoy once-pleasurable activities. Major depression is dis -
abling and prevents a person from functioning normally. 
An episode of major depression may occur only once in 
a person’s lifetime, but more often, it recurs throughout a 
person’s life. 

%
Dysthymic disorder,  also called dysthymia, is character -
ized by long-term (two years or longer) but less severe 
symptoms that may not disable a person but can prevent 
one from functioning normally or feeling well. People with 
dysthymia may also experience one or more episodes of 
major depression during their lifetimes.Bipolar disorder, also 
called manic-depressive 
illness, is not as common 
as major depression 
or dysthymia. Bipolar 
disorder is character -
ized by cycling mood 
changes—from extreme 
highs (e.g., mania) to 
extreme lows (e.g., 
depression). 
%
 Some forms of depressive disorder exhibit slightly differ -
ent characteristics than those described above, or they may 
develop under unique circumstances. However, not all sci -
entists agree on how to characterize and define these forms 
of depression. They include:
Psychotic depression,  which occurs when a severe depres -
sive illness is accompanied by some form of psychosis, such 
as a break with reality, hallucinations, and delusions.

%
Postpartum depression,  which is diagnosed if a new mother 
develops a major depressive episode within one month after 
delivery. It is estimated that 10 to 15 percent of women expe -
rience postpartum depression after giving birth.1 
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD),  which is character -
ized by the onset of a depressive illness during the winter 
months, when there is less natural sunlight. The depression 
generally lifts during spring and summer. 

%


People with depressive illnesses do not all experience the 
same symptoms. The severity, frequency and duration of 
symptoms will vary depending on the individual and his or 
her particular illness. 

%
symptoms include
Persistent sad, anxious or “empty” feelings
Feelings of hopelessness and/or pessimism
Feelings of guilt, worthlessness and/or helplessness
Irritability, restlessness
Loss of interest in activities or hobbies once  
pleasurable, including sex
Fatigue and decreased energy
Difficulty concentrating, remembering details  
and making decisions
Insomnia, early-morning wakefulness,  
or excessive sleeping
Overeating, or appetite loss
Thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts
Persistent aches or pains, headaches, cramps  
or digestive problems that do not ease even  
with treatment5What illnesses often co-exist with depression?

%
Depression often co-exists with other illnesses. Such ill -
nesses may precede the depression, cause it, and/or be a 
consequence of it. It is likely that the mechanics behind 
the intersection of depression and other illnesses differ 
for every person and situation. Regardless, these other co-
occurring illnesses need to be diagnosed and treated.
Anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder,  
social phobia and generalized anxiety disorder, often 
accompany depression.4 People experiencing PTSD are 
especially prone to having co-occurring depression. PTSD is 
a debilitating condition that can result after a person experi -
ences a terrifying event or ordeal, such as a violent assault, a 
natural disaster, an accident, terrorism or military combat. 
People with PTSD often re-live the traumatic event in flash -
backs, memories or nightmares.

%
 Other symptoms include 
irritability, anger outbursts, intense guilt, and avoidance of 
thinking or talking about the traumatic ordeal.5
Alcohol and other substance abuse or dependence  may also 
co-occur with depression.

%
Depression also often co-exists with other serious medical 
illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, hiv/ AiDS, 
diabetes, and Parkinson’s disease.  Studies have shown that 
people who have depression in addition to another serious 
medical illness tend to have more severe symptoms of both 
depression and the medical illness, more difficulty adapting 
to their medical condition, and more medical costs than those 
who do not have co-existing depression.

%

There is no single known cause of depression. Rather, it 
likely results from a combination of genetic, biochemical, 
environmental, and psychological factors. 

%
 The parts of the brain responsi -
ble for regulating mood, thinking, sleep, appetite and behav -
ior appear to function abnormally. In addition, important 
neurotransmitters—chemicals that brain cells use to com -
municate—appear to be out of balance. But these images 
do not reveal why the depression has occurred.

%
Some types of depression tend to run in families, suggest -
ing a genetic link. 

However, depression can occur in people 
without family histories of depression as well.9 Genetics 
research indicates that risk for depression results from the 
influence of multiple genes acting together with environ -
mental or other factors.10
In addition, trauma, loss of a loved one, a difficult relation -
ship, or any stressful situation may trigger a depressive 
episode. Subsequent depressive episodes may occur with 
or without an obvious trigger.
Research indicates that depressive illnesses 
are disorders of the brain.

%

Depression is more common among women than among men. 
Biological, life cycle, hormonal and psychosocial factors unique 
to women may be linked to women’s higher depression rate. 
Researchers have shown that hormones directly affect brain chem -
istry that controls emotions and mood.

% For example, women are 
particularly vulnerable to depression after giving birth, when hor -
monal and physical changes, along with the new responsibility of 
caring for a newborn, can be overwhelming. Many new moth -
ers experience a brief episode of the “baby blues, ” but some will 
develop postpartum depression, a much more serious condition 
that requires active treatment and emotional support for the new 
mother. Some studies suggest that women who experience post -
partum depression often have had prior depressive episodes.

%
Some women may also be susceptible to a severe form of premen -
strual syndrome (PMS), sometimes called premenstrual dysphoric 
disorder (PMDD), a condition resulting from the hormonal changes 
that typically occur around ovulation and before menstruation 
begins. During the transition into menopause, some women expe -
rience an increased risk for depression. 

%
Scientists are exploring how 
the cyclical rise and fall of estrogen and other hormones may affect 
the brain chemistry that is associated with depressive illness.11 
Finally, many women face the additional stresses of work and home 
responsibilities, caring for children and aging parents, abuse, pov -
erty, and relationship strains. It remains unclear why some women 
faced with enormous challenges develop depression, while others 
with similar challenges do not.

%

Men often experience depression differently than women and may 
have different ways of coping with the symptoms. Men are more 
likely to acknowledge having fatigue, irritability, loss of interest 
in once-pleasurable activities, and sleep disturbances, whereas 
women are more likely to admit to feelings of sadness, worthless -
ness and/or excessive guilt.

%
Men are more likely than women to turn to alcohol or drugs when 
they are depressed, or become frustrated, discouraged, irritable, 
angry and sometimes abusive. Some men throw themselves into 
their work to avoid talking about their depression with family or 
friends, or engage in reckless, risky behavior. And even though 
more women attempt suicide, many more men die by suicide.

%

Depression is not a normal part of aging, and studies show that 
most seniors feel satisfied with their lives, despite increased 
physical ailments. However, when older adults do have depres -
sion, it may be overlooked because seniors may show different, 
less obvious symptoms, and may be less inclined to experience 
or acknowledge feelings of sadness or grief.

%
In addition, older adults may have more medical conditions 
such as heart disease, stroke or cancer, which may cause 
depressive symptoms, or they may be taking medications with 
side effects that contribute to depression. Some older adults 
may experience what some doctors call vascular depression, 
also called arteriosclerotic depression or subcortical ischemic 
depression. Vascular depression may result when blood ves -
sels become less flexible and harden over time, becoming 
constricted. Such hardening of vessels prevents normal blood 
flow to the body’s organs, including the brain. Those with 
vascular depression may have, or be at risk for, a co-existing 
cardiovascular illness or stroke.

%
Although many people assume that the highest rates of sui -
cide are among the young, older white males age 85 and older 
actually have the highest suicide rate. Many have a depres -
sive illness that their doctors may not detect, despite the fact 
that these suicide victims often visit their doctors within one 
month of their deaths.

%
The majority of older adults with depression improve when 
they receive treatment with an antidepressant, psychotherapy, 
or a combination of both.18 Research has shown that medica -
tion alone and combination treatment are both effective in 
reducing the rate of depressive recurrences in older adults.19  
Psychotherapy alone also can be effective in prolonging peri -
ods free of depression, especially for older adults with minor 
depression, and it is particularly useful for those who are 
unable or unwilling to take antidepressant medication.
Depression is not a normal part of aging.

%

Scientists and doctors have begun to take seriously the risk of 
depression in children. Research has shown that childhood 
depression often persists, recurs and continues into adult -
hood, especially if it goes untreated. The presence of child -
hood depression also tends to be a predictor of more severe 
illnesses in adulthood.
%
A child with depression may pretend to be sick, refuse to go 
to school, cling to a parent, or worry that a parent may die. 
Older children may sulk, get into trouble at school, be nega -
tive and irritable, and feel misunderstood. Because these signs 
may be viewed as normal mood swings typical of children as 
they move through developmental stages, it may be difficult 
to accurately diagnose a young person with depression. 
Before puberty, boys and girls are equally likely to develop 
depressive disorders. By age 15, however, girls are twice as likely 
as boys to have experienced a major depressive episode.

%
Depression in adolescence comes at a time of great personal 
change—when boys and girls are forming an identity distinct 
from their parents, grappling with gender issues and emerg -
ing sexuality, and making decisions for the first time in their 
lives. Depression in adolescence frequently co-occurs with 
other disorders such as anxiety, disruptive behavior, eating 
disorders or substance abuse. It can also lead to increased 
risk for suicide.
Childhood depression often persists, recurs, and continues 
into adulthood, especially if left untreated.

%

Most people feel depressed at times. Losing a loved 
one, getting fired from a job, going through a 
divorce, and other difficult situations can lead a 
person to feel sad, lonely, scared, nervous, or anxious. 
Depression is more than just sadness. It interferes with daily 
life and causes pain for you and everyone who cares about 
you. It’s a common illness, but a very serious one.

%
The term “depression” often characterizes feelings of being 
sad, discouraged, hopeless, irritable, unmotivated, as well 
as a general lack of interest or pleasure in life. When these 
feelings last for a short period of time, it may be called a 
passing case of “the blues. ” But it’s likely to be a depressive 
disorder when they last for more than two weeks and 
interfere with regular daily activities.

%
Depressive disorders, also known as mood disorders, 
include three main types: major depression , persistent 
depressive disorder , and bipolar disorder . Depressive 
disorders can affect people of any age, including children, 
teenagers, adults, and older adults. 

%
Types of Depression
Major depression  involves at least five of the symptoms 
listed below for a two-week period. Such an episode is 
disabling and will interfere with the ability to work, study, 
eat, and sleep. Major depressive episodes may occur once 
or twice in a lifetime, or they may recur frequently. They 
may also take place spontaneously, during or after the 
death of a loved one, a romantic breakup, a medical illness, 
or other life event. Some people with major depression may 
feel that life is not worth living and some will attempt to end 
their lives.

%
A major depressive episode may include these symptoms:
 ▶Persistent sad mood, most of the day, nearly every day 
 ▶Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities, 
including sex
 ▶Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, helplessness
 ▶Decreased energy, fatigue, feeling “slowed down”
 ▶Difficulty concentrating, remembering, making 
decisions
 ▶Insomnia, early-morning awakening, or excessive 
sleeping
 ▶Low appetite and weight loss or overeating and weight 
gain
 ▶Thoughts of death or suicide, suicide attempts
 ▶Restlessness or irritability
 
 %
Persistent depressive disorder, or PDD , is a form of 
depression that usually continues for at least two years. 
Although it is less severe than major depression, it involves 
the same symptoms; sad mood combined with low energy, 
poor appetite or overeating, and insomnia or oversleeping. 
It can show up as stress, irritability, and mild anhedonia, 
which is the inability to derive pleasure from most activities.
Bipolar disorder , once called manic depression, is 
characterized by moods that shift from severe highs (mania) 
or mild highs (hypomania) to severe lows (depression). 
The mood episodes associated with the disorder persist 
from days to weeks or longer and may be dramatic. Severe 
changes in behavior go along with mood changes. 

%
During the manic phase , a person may experience 
abnormal or excessive elation, irritability, a decreased need 
for sleep, grandiose notions, increased talkativeness, racing 
thoughts, increased sexual desire, markedly increased 
energy, poor judgment, and inappropriate social behavior. 
A manic episode is diagnosed if an elevated mood occurs 
with three or more primary symptoms present most of the 
day, nearly every day, for at least one week. With an irritable 
mood, four additional symptoms must be present for a 
diagnosis.

%
Signs and symptoms of a manic episode can include the 
following:
 ▶Increased energy, activity, and restlessness 
 ▶Excessively high, overly good, euphoric mood 
 ▶Extreme irritability 
 ▶Racing thoughts and talking very fast, jumping from one 
idea to another 
 ▶Distractibility, inability to concentrate well 
 ▶Little sleep needed 
 ▶Unrealistic beliefs in one’s abilities and powers  ▶Poor judgment 
 ▶Spending sprees 
 ▶A lasting period of behavior that is different from usual 
 ▶Increased sexual drive 
 ▶Abuse of drugs, particularly cocaine, alcohol, and 
sleeping medications 
 ▶Provocative, intrusive, or aggressive behavior 
 ▶Denial that anything is wrong 
 
 %
During the depressive phase , a person experiences the 
symptoms of major depression. A depressive episode is 
diagnosed if five or more primary depressive symptoms last 
most of the day, nearly every day, for a period of two weeks 
or longer.

%
Signs and symptoms of a depressive episode can include 
the following:
 ▶Lasting sad or empty mood 
 ▶Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism 
 ▶Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness 
 ▶Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed, 
including sex 
 ▶Decreased energy, a feeling of fatigue or of being 
“slowed down” 
 ▶Difficulty concentrating, remembering, making 
decisions 
 ▶Restlessness or irritability 
 ▶Sleeping too much, or having trouble sleeping 
 ▶Change in appetite or unintended weight loss or gain 
 ▶Thoughts of death or suicide
 ▶Suicide attempts

%
Depression and anxiety disorders are not the same, 
but people with depression often experience 
nervousness, irritability, and problems sleeping 
and concentrating, and other symptoms similar to 
an anxiety disorder. It is not uncommon for someone 
with an anxiety disorder to suffer from depression and 
vice versa. Nearly one-half of those diagnosed with 
depression are also diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. 
The term “anxiety disorder” includes generalized 
anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder and panic 
attacks, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder , 
selective mutism, separation anxiety, and specific 
phobias. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are closely 
related to anxiety disorders, which some may 
experience at the same time as depression.
Each disorder has its own causes and its own emotional 
and behavioral symptoms. 

%
Many people who develop 
depression have a history of an anxiety disorder earlier in 
life. There is no evidence one disorder causes the other, 
but there is clear evidence that many people suffer from 
both disorders. The good news is that these disorders are 
treatable, separately and together.

%
Depression in Children, 
Adolescents, and Teens
It may be difficult to tell if a child, adolescent, or teen 
is suffering from depression. Risk factors include 
being under stress; experiencing loss; or having 
attention, learning, or conduct disorders. In addition, 
girls are more likely than boys to develop depression, 
and younger children who develop depression are 
likely to have a family history of the illness.

Ruling out physical symptoms, a pediatrician may suggest 
a psychiatric evaluation. It is not uncommon for children, 
even very young children, to be diagnosed with depression. 

%
During adolescence, with its many personal and social 
changes, depression can take hold. Persistent unhappiness 
or moodiness is not normal. Look for these symptoms:
 ▶Depressed or irritable mood
 ▶Inability to feel pleasure 
 ▶Loss of interest in usual activities; withdrawal from 
friends
 ▶Change in grades, getting into trouble at school, or 
refusing to go to school
 ▶Loss of appetite or eating too much
 ▶Weight loss or weight gain
 ▶Problems falling sleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too 
much
 ▶Feeling angry 
 ▶Mood swings
 ▶Frequent sadness or 
crying
 ▶Feeling worthless 
and guilty
Treatable


%
Depression is most likely due to a combination of genetic, 
biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Brain-
imaging technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI), have shown that the parts of the brain involved in 
mood, thinking, sleep, appetite, and behavior of people 
who have depression function differently than those of 
people without it. 

%
Some types of depression tend to run in families. Genetics 
research indicates that risk for depression results from 
several genes acting in concert with environmental and 
other factors. Also, trauma, loss of a loved one, a difficult 
relationship, or any stressful situation may trigger a 
depressive episode. Episodes may also occur without an 
obvious trigger. And the illness can occur in people without 
any family history.

%
Postpartum Depression 
Following childbirth, about 10 to 15 percent of 
women experience postpartum depression, which 
is depression associated with the aftermath of 
pregnancy. About 30 to 70 percent experience symptoms 
for one year or longer. Most women with postpartum 
depression are diagnosed with minor depression, but 
4 to 5 percent meet the criteria for major depression.  
Postpartum depression is associated with severe and 
persistent symptoms that are present most of the day nearly 
every day for at least two weeks. It is also associated with 
reduced mother-infant bonding and increased marital stress 
and divorce. 

%
Symptoms usually begin within the first four weeks of giving 
birth, although some women report decreasing mood in 
the late third trimester of pregnancy. Below are common 
symptoms:
 ▶Sad mood
 ▶Loss of interest or 
pleasure in things that 
you normally enjoy
 ▶Fatigue or loss of 
energy
 ▶Appetite increase or 
decrease
 ▶Sleeping too much or insomnia
 ▶Feeling restless or as though you are slowed down
 ▶Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt
 ▶Difficulty concentrating or indecisiveness
 ▶Thoughts of death or suicide or a suicide plan
 ▶Anxiety and ruminating thoughts, which may occur with 
other mood symptoms 

%
A rapid decrease in some hormones after delivery may be a 
risk factor, and others include stressors, previous depressive 
episodes, depression while pregnant, complications 
during pregnancy or delivery, and a family history of mood disorders.
Recent studies have shown that among women who 
are diagnosed, about one-third had depression prior to their pregnancy, one-third have depression that began 
during pregnancy, and one-third experienced the onset of 
depression after delivery.

%
Many people with a depressive illness never seek treatment. But most, even those with the most 
severe depression, can get better with some 
form of treatment. Those shown to be effective include 
antidepressant medications and forms of psychotherapy, 
as well as newly developed treatments. Early diagnosis and 
intervention with appropriate treatment are always critical steps to feeling better, especially for children and teens.

 People who kill themselves 
usually exhibit one or more warning signs, either through

Sadness, often referred to as “depression”, is a normal emotion. All people at some time or 
the other experience low mood, low spirits, disinterest or disgust. Like all emotions, it 
serves an important function. Sadness can be understood as the mental equivalent of 
physical pain. It acts as a signal or warning to inform us of a loss, or of the failure to attain 
a particular goal. This, in turn, leads to certain behaviours that help us cope with such 
situations.  

%
In certain situations,  and circumstances, this normal response crosses a limit: it becomes 
either unbearable or problematic , lasts longer than expected, or interferes with sleep, 
appetite or day to  day functioning . Depression is ubiquitous. The word “depression” is 
often confusing to doctors and laypersons alike, because it is interchangeably used to 
describe an emotion, a symptom, a syndrome, and a disease in the classic meanings of those 
words.  A person who feels sad over a life event  or stressor  may describe himself as feeling 
“depressed”, but this is quite different from the disorder known as depression  or depressive 
disorder . The term “clinical depression” has been used by some doctors  to make a 
distinction between the two. Because of the very diversity of depression in all its aspects, 
the problems at both theoretical and clinical levels are at once stimulating, challenging, and 
often frustrating.   
 
%
 The group 
of conditions in which sadness of mood is the predominant symptom, or one of them, are 
referred to as depressive disorders. They are one of the commonest types of psychi atric 
disorders.  They are also the commonest psychiatric problems that a general practitioner or 8 
 family physician is likely to encounter, in some form or the other.  Unfortunately, 
depressive disorders are also the most likely conditions to be missed, go undetected or 
inappropriately treated in such a setting.  A major psychotic episode, let us say, of 
schizophrenia, can be diagnosed and treated with much more ease than an episode of mild 
or moderate depression.  

 
 % 
Depression is consistently found to be more common in women than in men, with a ratio 
of approximately 2 to 1.  While morbidity is hig her in women, mortality in the form of 
suicide is greater in men.  Suicidal attempts – sometimes referred to as parasuicide - on the 
other hand, are more common among women. However, this may not be true in India, 
where the use of methods such as poisoning  and self -immolation among women may result 
in almost equal mortality compared to men: male -to-female ratios of 1:1.2 to 1:1.7 have 
been found. A study from Chennai found that depression was associated with a 19 -fold

A number of risk factors associated with depressive disorders have been noted: female 
gender, personality type, unemployment, poverty, illiteracy, problems in personal 
relationships, lack of social support, certain occupations (for example, business), certain 
castes, and living arrangements, such as men living in joint families. Depressive disorders 
sometimes run in families, with many members being affected. Having a chronic physical 
illness,  or another mental disorder, also raises the risk of depression. Certain factors, such 
as a supportive family, social or religious environment, may protect against depression.

To Recapitulate …  
❖ Depressive disorders are one of the commonest types of psychiatric disorder.  
❖ The general practitioner or family physician is likely to encounter depression, in 
one form or another, as the commonest psychiatric problem.  
❖ Clinic -based studies on depression in India have noted rates of 6% to 35%.  
❖ Depression is mor e common in women than in men, at a ratio of approximately 2 
to 1. 
❖ Although there are indications that the incidence of depression is highest at middle 
age, it occurs at all ages.  10 
 ❖ There are indications of higher rates of depression in North India compared to South 
India.  
❖ Risk factors for depression are  
• Female gender,  
• Social or economic deprivation – poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, caste status,  
• Personality type,  
• Problems in personal relationships – such as marital disharmony,  
• Lack of social support,  
• Genetics – though this does not apply in all cases  
• Having another chronic physical or mental illness.

No single factor can possibly explain th is complex human experience of depression.  Thus, 
depression is considered to be a multifactorial disorder.  The relative contribution of each 
factor may be different in each case.  The various factors identified to be involved in the 
causation of depression  are discussed in the following paragraphs.  

%
It is clear that hereditary factors predispose some individuals to the development of 
depression, though depression is not, strictly speaking, a “hereditary disease” such as 
haemophilia. In this connection, it is not only the occurrence of depressive disor ders in the 
family members of the individuals but also a number of other related illnesses that are 
implicated.  Genetic factors are thought to play a role in vulnerability to these disorders, 
which are called depressive spectrum disorders. These disorders  include alcoholism, drug 
abuse and antisocial personality in men, and somatization  and dissociative disorders in 
women. There is also a strong genetic link between anxiety, especially generalized anxiety, 
and depression. Recent work has shown that the int eraction of genetic factors with life 
stressors probably leads to the development of depression.  
 
%
These are very easily acknowledged in most cases.  Environmental factors are considered 
to be etiologically important in some types o f depression.  These may occur in the form of 
either change in the internal environment, for example intercurrent or chronic illnesses or 
medications which can cause depression – or, more frequently, external environmental 
factors in the form of various st ressors. Besides stressors, social factors such as rapid 
economic or cultural change, migration, urbanization and even globalization have been 
thought to play a role in the development of depression. Though external environmental 
factors can be demonstrate d in many types of depression – and, indeed, in many other 12 
 illnesses, physical and mental - they are not necessarily involved in the causation of every 
depression.  
 
%
Life events are significant and important changes occurring in the individual’ s life which 
produce stress and require adaptability from the individual.  Positive and negative social 
experiences and relationships seem to play an important role in the development of some, 
but not all, forms of depression. Life events can also affect t he kinds of symptoms that 
patients present to their physicians. For example, depression that is triggered by loss, such 
as through death or separation, is associated with high levels of sadness, inability to feel 
pleasure, loss of appetite, and guilt. On t he other hand, depression triggered by failures  is 
associated with symptoms of fatigue and increased sleep.  

%
The final common pathway of the many etiologic factors in any depression is the biological 
response of a given individual, which is  manifested in the form of biochemical changes as 
well as psychological and behavioral symptoms.  
For clinical purposes, a detailed study of all theoretical factors involved in depression is 
less important than careful observation and timely intervention fo r depressed patients.  
Thus, a through evaluation of the depressed patient should include assessing familial, 
environmental, social and physiological factors to understand the contribution of each 
factor to the development of depression in his or her case.   Assessment and evaluation will 
be further discussed in another chapter.

There are numerous symptoms which have been considered to be characteristic of 
depression.  These clinical features are summarized in the following table.  
Clinical symptoms of depression  
1. Affective or mood symptoms  
2. Cognitive or thought symptoms  
3. Behavioural symptoms  
4. Physical , bodily  or somatic symptoms  
5. Biological symptoms  
6. Psychotic symptoms  
7. Neurocognitive symptoms  
 
%
Sadness of mood is considered to be the key symptom of depression.  Sadness, when 
severe, may be accompanied by a desire to weep or crying spells.  The person feels 
extremely sad and cannot “pull” himself out of  it.  Normally when a person feels sad, he 
can “cheer himself up” by certain activities or thoughts, but a depressed person finds this 
strategy to be ineffective.  The depressed person also feels dejected and disappointed.  
Another characteristic affective feature is the inability to enjoy or derive pleasure from 
usual activities which gave him pleasure earlier , also known as anhedonia .  Similarly, there 
is a lack of interest in common day -to-day activities, like reading newspapers, watching 
television, or meeting or talking to people.  

%
The person  describes himself  or herself  as sad, gloomy, low in spirits, depressed, miserable, 
“as if a black cloud has come over him”.  In severe cases, this dejection is all -pervading 
and may be completely uninfluenced to the environment.  Some patients describe a 
qualitative difference between their mood and normal sadness.  The mood is unpleasant 
and patients experience a degree of “psychic pain” which causes them more anguish than 14 
 the worst of physical pains.  They take no p leasure in anything, and their interests become 
narrowed or lost completely.  

%
Depressed mood can be distinguished from normal sadness by its persistence, its tendency 
to come flooding back even after momentary distraction, its painfulness, its relative 
invariance or persistence in response to changing circumstances, and the inability of the 
patient to divert his thoughts to more cheerful events or memories.  
Depressed mood can be recognized without the accompaniment of a depressed appearance, 
but the latter w ill increase confidence that one is dealing with a pathological state.  The 
face looks sad, with the corners of the mouth downturned, deepened nasolabial folds, the 
eyes downcast with the eyebrows drawn together and their medial ends raised obliquely.  
The forehead shows vertical ridges with horizontal furrows in the center.  There may be 
tears or an appearance of dry -eyed sadness.  They face may seem frozen or stiff in grief.  
 
%
Affective symptoms of depression  
1. Dejected mood  
2. Negative feelings about oneself  
3. Reduction in enjoyment  
4. Loss of emotional attachments  
5. Crying spells    
 
%
These usually manifest as “bad” or “negative” thoughts about the self, about the outside 
world (including the family, and workplace), and about the future.  The person feels “low” 
about himself, and has no confidence, low self -esteem and disturbances of bo dy image; 
this may progress to outright feelings of worthlessness. He tends to blame himself for minor 
mistakes, and many times there is an unreasonable feeling of guilt and self -blame. The 
depressed person feels hopeless, and has a bleak and pessimistic v iew of the future.  He 
also feels terribly helpless, and may believe that there is nothing that he, or anyone else, 
can do to improve his current situation.  He finds it difficult to make decisions and thus 
keeps procrastinating. He might get fed up of lif e and feel life is not worth living.  These 15 
 thoughts may subsequently lead to suicidal ideas and death wishes, such as thinking that it 
would be “better if I went to sleep and never woke up” or that he would be “better off 
dead”.  

%
In some cases, patients ma y feel morally worthless.  Associated with this feeling is the 
tendency to feel guilty.  Ma ny mildly depressed patients may feel they are to blame for 
getting themselves into this state, and think that they are a source of trouble, or a “burden”, 
to their relatives.  This is to be distinguished from pathological guilt, the essence of which 
is inappropriate self -blame (see “Psychotic symptoms”, below).  
 
 
%
Cognitive symptoms of depression are
1. Low self -evaluation.  
2. Negative expectations – pessimism, hopelessness.  
3. Self-blame and self -criticism, guilt.  
4. Indecisiveness.  
5. Disturbances of body image.  
6. Problems with concentration and memory  
7. Motivational manifestations like:  
• Paralysis of the will,  
• Avoidance, escapist and withdrawal wishes,  
• Death wishes and suic idal ideas,  
• Increased dependency.  
 
%
A depressed person is slowed down, both in behaviour and in mental processes.  This is 
known as psychomotor retardation .  He may take a long time to finish his usual tasks, such 
as eating or doing simple activities.  He is slow to take care of his personal hygiene and 
thus might have appear unkempt, with poor attention to his appearance.  On the other hand, 
sometimes depre ssed persons are very restless and agitated.  Such patients feel very 
nervous, have high levels of anxiety and distress, and may be unable to remain still; they 
may constantly be moving about or bemoaning their fate.  16 
  
  
%
By and large, most depressed patients in our country suffer from somatic complaints when 
depressed. These “somatic complaints” include many common physical complaints, such 
as headache, low back pain, abdominal pain, multiple aches and pains constipation , 
tiredness or fatigue. Others may present with more vague complaints, such as lethargy, , 
feeling weak, or feeling “run -down”. This is of special significance for general physicians 
and medical specialists since the depressed patient is likely to consult them first quite 
naturally due to their physical distress.  It is important to analyze and investigate such 
symptoms appropriately. While depression must not be missed, it is also important to 
identify the symptoms of any physical disorder that may be cont ributing to depression.  
 
%
Disturbed sleep is the commonest biological symptom of depression.  In fact, the 
occurrence of sadness along with disturbed sleep might be a good indication that the 
sadness is morbid or pathological, and thus one can differentiate it from normal sadness.  
The commonest sleep disturbance is a reduction in total sleep time.  Depressed patients 
have difficulty in falling asleep (initial insomnia), have numerous interruptions while 
asleep (middle insomnia) and also  wake up much earlier in the morning than usual 
(terminal insomnia). Moreover, the depressed person might report than he does not feel 
fresh on awakening  and has a poor quality of sleep .  In contrast, some depressed persons 
might have increased sleep.  

%
Appe tite is also reduced commonly in depression.  When severe and long -standing, it can 
lead to loss of weight.  Sometimes a depressed patient may complain that food has lost its 
taste, and thus explain his reduced intake of food.  Weight loss could also be du e to loss of 
interest in eating food.  As in the case of sleep, some depressed patients could have 
increased appetite, craving for carbohydrate -rich foods, and weight gain.  17 
 Loss of libido is also reported.  The depressed person has a decreased interest in sexual 
activity.  Men may also report difficulty in attaining an erection, and both genders may 
complain of difficulties in arousal or orgasm.  
Biological symptoms of depression  
1. Loss of appetite  
2. Sleep disturbance  
3. Loss of libido  
 
 
%
There are certain psychotic symptoms which also might occur in depression. These are 
usually in the form of delusions and hallucinations, and will be discussed under the heading 
of psychotic depression  in a later chapter. Delusions in depression can be und erstood as 
extremes of the negative thoughts mentioned earlier. For example, a depressed patient 
worried about his job may develop a delusion that he has lost all his money, and that his 
family will be forced to “live on the streets”.  

%
Similarly, in some pa tients, ideas of guilt can become fully delusional.  The patient may 
accuse himself of a heinous sin or crime, or believe that he will be punished by God for his 
past “misdeeds”. There may be a grandiose element in these delusions, with the patient 
believi ng that some action or omission of his is responsible for great disasters in faraway 
places. Such a patient may also have “guilty ideas of reference”, in which he feels that 
those around him are blaming him or even accusing him.  Similarly, delusions of 
persecution are often an extension of this line of thought, the patient feeling that others, 
such as the police, are quite justified in “punishing” him for his acts. However, not all 
depressed patients with delusions of persecution do feel their persecutions  are justified.  
 
%
Common psychotic symptoms in depression  
Delusions  
1. Persecution and reference  
2. Worthlessness  18 
 3. Nihilism  
4. Somatic  
5. Poverty  
6. Crime and punishment  
 
Hallucinations  – usually having a depressive tone, in the form of hearing 
voices denigrating the depre ssed person.  
Severely depressed patients may experience auditory hallucinations.  These are 
usually ‘second person’ - that is, they address the patient directly - and are 
always consistent with the patient's mood, being derogatory, critical, jeering, 
or fo retelling disaster. Some patients may describe voices ordering them to kill 
themselves. However, they are not persistent – if they are, the possibility of 
schizophrenia should be considered.  
 
%
Depression can cause also disturbances in memory and concentration. A depressed person 
may find it difficult to concentrate on tasks and may be easily distracted by the above 
thoughts. He may also find it difficult to remember things and perceive himself as  being 
“forgetful” or “slowed down”.  
 
%
These may be prominent or altogether missing – they include a sad facial expression, 
stooped posture, tearfulness and motor retardation or agitation.  At times, depressed 
patients may put on a smi le for social reasons, the so -called ‘smiling depression’.   
Speech may be retarded, with a delay in answering and gaps between phrases and words.  
The voice may die away at the end of the sentence and often has a monotonous tone.  
The patient may experienc e subjective slowing of movements, the feeling that he can only 
move in slow motion.  Energy is reduced, as is work output and efficiency.  The patient 
may look retarded, with a slow laboured walk and a reduction of purposive and expressive 
movements. 

% 
In extreme cases, the patient may pass into a depressive stupor  in which he 19 
 remains nearly immobile and mute. Such patients may need feeding but are rarely 
incontinent, as is seen in stupor due to brain damage.  

%
Some patients are visibly agitated with much pur poseless activity, pacing up and down, 
wringing their hands and showing signs of obvious distress.  
The above signs are commonly described in psychiatric practice. However, virtually any 
symptom of which patients commonly complain can be associated with depression.  Dry 
mouth, constipation, difficulty concentrating, poor memory, dryness of the skin and many 
other symptoms have been associated by patients with their depression.

CLINICAL EFATURES OF DEPRESSION  
❖ Sadness of mo od is a key symptom of depression, and when severe may be 
accompanied by a desire to weep or crying spells  
❖ Inability to enjoy or derive pleasure from usual activities which gave pleasure 
earlier.  
❖ Lack of interest in day -to-day activities.  
❖ Bad thoughts – about oneself, the outside world (family, friends, work), and the 
future.  
❖ Self-blame, self -criticism and guilt.

The clinical assessment includes an evaluation of the signs and symptoms of depression, 
described in the previous chapter.  It would involve establishing whether the person has a 
depressive disorder or not, and if present, the severity of the depressive features.  
 
% 
Patients with depression often present a confusing picture and pose management problems 
for the physician.  In the absence of a straightforward complaint about depressed mood, 
and in the presence of many somatic complaints it seems quite natural to pursue general 
medical, or “organic”, causes for the patient’s complaints.  

%
The distinction between 
“organic” and “psychological” causes is spurious. In the end, depression - which peop le 
complain of in ‘psychological’ terms - is the result of brain dysfunction which is as yet 
poorly understood.  Physicians are increasingly aware of the many different presentations 
of depression, and consideration of depression as an explanation for the patient’s 
complaints has risen higher on most physicians' lists of common medical problems.  
Once the possibility of depressive illness has been recognized, physicians can often move 
fairly quickly to confirm their suspicions and institute appropriate antid epressant treatment.  
Masked depression can sometimes by uncovered by the use of depression questionnaires.  
A carefully conducted interview which explores the status of mood, thinking, vegetative 24 
 functioning and general behaviour will usually provide the data necessary for a differential 
diagnosis among the depressive disorders. 

%
History -taking of this kind is best done in an 
unhurried and uninterrupted fashion.  This pattern of history taking may be difficult to 
arrange on short notice in a busy practice,  but detailed history of this kind is just as useful 
as a detailed general history and complete physical examination.  A careful psychiatric 
history can often be scheduled in a block of time usually reserved for a complete medical 
history and physical exam ination.  
 
 
% 

Major depression  
When most of the aforementioned symptoms have been present nearly continuously for a 
period of at least two weeks, the condition is referred to as major depression , or a 
depressive episode . Depressive episodes are clear -cut episodes, lasting weeks to months or 
even years – their average duration is about 6 to 9 months. Patients are completely well 
before and after an episode, but major depression has a tendency to recur in over two -thirds 
patients. If more than one episode occurs in a patient, the term recurrent depression  can be 
used.  
 
#
Criteria for the diagnosis of major depression  
(Adapted from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition)  
 
Primary criteria – these must be present in all cases to make the diagnosis  
1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day.  
2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all activities  
 
Secondary criteria – in addition to (1) and (2), any three of these should be present for a 
period of at least two weeks,  for a total of at least 5 symptoms.  
3. Significant weight loss or weight gain (total change of 5% body weight)  
4. Decreased sleep (insomnia) or increased sleep (hypersomnia)  
5. Slowness (psychomotor retardation) or agitation  
6. Fatigue or loss of energy  
7. Feelings of w orthlessness or excessive guilt  
8. Difficulty in concentrating, thinking or making decisions  
9. Recurrent thoughts of dying or committing suicide  

%
 A depressive episode can be further graded as mild, moderate or severe based on how much 
these symptoms impair the patient's functioning in social and occupational situations.  
 
 
%  
First of all, it seems appropriate to separate primary from secondary depression.  Primary 
depressions are those which arise in and of themselves, while secondary depressions follow 
in the train of some other illness or event. Other terms that have been commonly used 
include:  
• Endogenous  and reactive  depression  
• Psychotic  and neurotic  depression  
The first set of terms refers to the probable  cause  of a depressive episode, while the second 
refer to symptom profile. These terms, however, have not stood the test of time.  In some 
ways, endogenous depression may appear synonymous with primary depression and 
reactive with secondary. The endogenous -reactive dichotomy is sometimes taken to be 
synonymous with severity, with many people equating endogenous with psychotic and 
reactive with neurotic depression respectively.

%
 That this is an oversimplification becomes 
clear when one must treat a patient with what appears to be a lifelong neurotic illness, for 
which no external precipitants in the life of the individual can be identified - an 
“endogenous neurotic” depression. Conversely, one sometimes sees acutely depressed 
patients with psychotic symptoms  ith a good premorbid personality who “come apart” as 
a result of severe trauma – a “reactive depressive psychosis”.   

%
It is probably most consistent and useful at this point in time to recognize  the limitations 
of the endogenous -reactive and psychotic -neurotic dualisms since they add more confusion 
than clarity to the process of classification.  They do remain clinically useful in treatment 
selection, and we will retain them for that reason.  
Over the years, the term endogenous depression has been used for a  multitude of purposes.  
Among them are:  
1. The opposite of neurotic or reactive depression,  
2. Depression occurring in people with normal premorbid personalities,  
3. Depression with no precipitating event,  27 
 4. Depression that responds to somatic treatment (medication or ECT),  
5. Depression with a characteristic complex of symptoms, principally vegetative 
symptoms, diurnal variation, and early morning awakening.  
 
 
%
The term neurotic depression also carries a multitude of meanings, often with etiologic 
connotations.  Neurotic  depression, has been variously defined as being mild depression, 
non-psychotic depression, depression that is less socially incapacitating, depression 
following a life event, depression without endogenous symptoms, or depression arising in 
individuals wit h long -standing characterologic al problems.  These definitions are not 
comparable, and thus lead to confusion.  

%
The common characteristics of neurotic depression can be summarized as:  
• It is mild,  
• It is nonpsychotic, i.e. lacks psychotic symptoms,  
• It is less socially incapacitating,  
• It is situational or reactive, as a reaction to an event or situation,  
• No endogenous symptoms, like marked loss of weight, appetite, guilt, diurnal 
variation is prominent,  
• The depressive symptoms are worse in the evening,  
• They tend to blame others  
• Sleep is disturbed, intermittent awakening, or difficulty in falling sleep,  
• Characterological, in terms of being long term,  
• It results from an unconscious conflict which usually cannot be easily identified,  
• It is associated with other neuroses like anxiety, obsessions, conversion, 
somatization or hypochondriasis.  
 
 
%
Dysthymia (chronic  depressive disorder)  
 
The word dysthymia means “ill -humoured”. Dysthymia is characterised by a chronic 
nonpsychotic depression, of more than 2 years' duration, involving either depressed mood 
or loss of interest or pleasure in all or almost all usual acti vities and pastimes, and 
associated symptoms as mentioned above, but not of sufficient severity to qualify for a 28 
 depressive episode.  Patients may describe themselves as chronically feeling sad, blue, 
“down in the dumps” or low.  

%
The depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure may be either relatively persistent or 
intermittent and separated by periods of normal mood, interest and pleasure.  These normal 
periods last a few days to a few weeks. Patients do not experience delusions or 
hallucinations, and ar e usually less impaired in their functioning than those with 
depression.  

%
The exact prevalence of dysthymia is not known.  However, the condition is probably 
common among outpatients.  The disorder is more common in women.  This disorder 
usually begins earl y in adult life, and for this reason was earlier referred to as depressive 
personality.  In other cases, it may begin at a later period.  
Such patients can develop superimposed major depressive episodes, which may cause 
marked impairment in their ability to  function or require hospitalization. Such depressions 
are called ‘double depression’. 

%
 Dysthymia is also associated with a risk of developing  
substance abuse, particularly in men.  
A predisposing factor is the presence of a chronic physical disorder, chron ic life stresses, 
or another psychiatric disorder, such as a personality disorder or major depression which 
does not completely remit and merges imperceptibly into this condition.  
 
  
% 
The essential feature of an adju stment disorder is a maladaptive reaction to an identifiable 
life event or circumstance, and which is not merely an exacerbation of an already existing 
the mental disorder. Adjustment disorders usually remit if and when the stressor ceases.  
The maladaptiv e nature of the reaction is indicated by the presence of either impairment in 
social or occupational function or symptoms, or other behaviours that are in excess of an 
expected and culturally appropriate reaction to the stressor.  There may or may not be a  
concurrent personality disorder or organic mental disorder, which may render the 
individual more vulnerable to the adjustment disorder.  

%
Stressors may be single, such as an uncomplicated divorce, or multiple, such as the death 
of a loved one occurring at a  time of marked job difficulties and physical illness.  They 29 
 may be recurrent, as with chronic illness, unemployment, or financial difficulties.  They 
may occur in a family setting, as with discordant familial relationships.  They may be likely 
to be limit ed in effect to the patient, such as being the victim of a crime or having a 
psychological reaction to physical illness. Finally, they may occur in a group or community 
setting where the stressor involves many others, such as a natural disaster, or persecution 
based on racial, social, religious, caste or other group characteristics.  Some stressors are 
associated with specific developmental stages, such as going to school, failing to attain 
occupational goals, the last child leaving home (“the empty nest sy ndrome”) and 
retirement. They may also be associated with transitions in the life cycle: puberty and 
adolescence, marriage, parenting, menopause, and old age. 

% 
The severity and impact of the stressor is a complex function of the nature and number of 
stresso rs, their duration, reversibility, and the environmental and personal context.  For 
example, the stress of losing one’s parents is, not unexpectedly, different for a child of ten 
and a married man in middle age.  

%
The manifestations of the disorder are varied.  Depressive or anxious features, or a 
combination of mixed emotional features, are particularly common, especially among 
adults.  Physical symptoms may occur at any age, but are more likely to be seen in children 
or among the elderly.  Disturbances of conduct are more common in children or 
adolescents, but can also be seen at other ages.  They may include aggression, reckless 
driving, use of alcohol and other substances, or failing to meet responsibilities.  In other 
instances withdrawal may be the prima ry presenting symptom. Various admixtures of these 
symptoms, sometimes referred to as “mixed disorder or emotions and conduct”, can also 
be seen.  

%
Adjustment disorder is common, though its exact prevalence is not known. The age of onset 
and course are varia ble.  The symptoms do not necessarily begin immediately after the 
stressor.  The onset may be either immediate or delayed and either sudden or gradual.  
Though many adjustment disorders resolve with time, some may be chronic or even 
lifelong due to the per sistence of the stressor.  
Reactive depression needs to be differentiated from normal grief or uncomplicated 
bereavement which, although associated temporarily with impaired social and occupational 30 
 functioning, is an expected reaction to the loss of a loved one and thus is not consi dered an 
adjustment disorder.  

%
Other mental disorders from which an adjustment disorder must be distinguished include 
major depressive disorder, dysthymia, disorder, brief reactive psychosis, generalized 
anxiety disorder, somatization disorder, the various substance use disorders, conduct 
disorders and posttraumatic stress disorders.  
 
%  
Depressive symptoms in relation to physical illnesses may persist longer and be more 
severe than those seen in adjustment disorders.  However, it must be stressed that there is 
no clear separation between the two diagnostic categories of reactive and secon dary 
depression. A diagnosis of Reactive depression is considered as the psychological reaction 
to a stress factor, more severe than the adjustment disorder, secondary depression is due to 
the biological changes due to medical disease or side effects of me dications for the medical 
disease.  Usually , the symptoms are depressive in nature, but features of anxiety are also 
common.  

%
The category of secondary depression allows a useful conceptual framework for 
understanding symptoms following physical illness.  I n secondary depression, depression 
follows and parallels a significant, life -threatening or severe medical illness. Secondary 
depression must be distinguished from symptomatic depression, as discussed below. It 
would be more logical to restrict the term to  describe depression that follows the diagnosis 
of a medical illness whose nature is appreciated by the patient. These syndromes of 
depression with or without anxiety result from the patient’s awareness of the illness and its 
implications.  

%
Some important differences need to be considered when diagnosing secondary depression 
in the medically ill.  The characteristic somatic symptoms of depression - insomnia, 
anorexia, weight loss and bodily pains - do not have the same significance in this population 
and can not be relied upon from a diagnostic viewpoint. They may all be attributable to the 
underlying physical disorder.  Reliance must therefore be placed on the psychological 
symptoms – low mood, loss of pleasure and interest in activities, and negative thought s or 
views of the self, the world and the future – in diagnosing depression in these patients.

%  
 Depressed patients in medical wards are less deeply depressed as a whole, though some 
may have severe depression. They more often ha ve feelings of pessimism, h elplessness, 
anxiety and self -pity but less often ha ve suicidal feelings. The core symptoms of depression 
in medical patients were identified as: feeling like a failure, loss of interest in people, 
feeling punished, suicidal ideas, dissatisfaction, difficu lty with making decisions and 
crying.  
 
%
In some patients, depression may develop over the course of chronic medical conditions, 
such as renal failure, liver failure, or infections such as tubercu losis. While some of these 
depressions may be “secondary” to the stress of having a serious illness, as discussed 
above, others are due to chemical and metabolic changes that accompany these disorders, 
which indirectly alter the functioning of the brain. S uch conditions are commonly seen in 
general hospital settings. Treating the underlying condition (for example, with dialysis or 
antituberculous treatment) may reverse depression.  
 
%
This term is best used for disorders presenting with symptoms characteristic of a depressive 
episode, but in which cerebral dysfunction can be assumed with reasonable certainty from 
the patient’s clinical condition.  This implies that the functional symptoms develop as a 
result of organic brain di sease, or a general medical condition affecting brain function. 
Such disorders are also referred to as “depression due to a general medical condition” or 
“organic mood disorders”. Symptomatic depression can also be due to the effects of using 
or experienci ng withdrawal from a drug of abuse, such as alcohol or cocaine. This type of 
depression is also called “substance -induced mood disorder”. 

% 
Symptomatic disorders often occur in people who are unaware that they are physically ill 
and the disorders consequentl y assume special significance as the initial manifestation of 
an illness that has not yet declared itself.  They can take the form of any functional disorder, 
but depressive and anxiety disorders are the commonest.  They emphasize  the importance 32 
 of a thoro ugh physical examination in all psychiatrically ill patients.  
 
 %Mood disorders 
should be suspected of being symptomatic of an underlying physical illness especially in 
the following circumstances:  
• The mood disorder presents for the first time in middle or l ate life,  
• There is a stable premorbid personality,  
• There is no family history of psychiatric illness  
• There is no apparent psychosocial precipitant  
• Depression is associated with signs and symptoms suggestive of a general medical 
or neurological condition  
Several groups of physical illness are known to be associated with depressive syndromes.  
 
%
Neurological diseases  
Depression is a common complication of neurological diseases, particularly 
cerebrovascular disease.  Depression is common after a stroke and ap proximately a quarter 
of patients experience severe depression, while another quarter experience minor degrees 
of depression.  At first sight, these are not unexpected observations, given the major 
disabilities which stroke patients experience.  But severa l studies have shown little 
correlation between post -stroke depression and the degree of physical disability in the 
weeks immediately after the stroke.  However, the association becomes more pronounced 
with time, so that a complex interaction between mood and physical impairment is 
established.  

%
Major depression is more frequent in patients with strokes involving the left frontal cortex 
and left basal ganglia.  Non -fluent aphasia also occurs after left frontal lesions, but this 
does not seem sufficient to ex plain the development of depression because a similar degree 
of depression occurs with left frontal lesions not complicated by aphasia.  Subcortical 
atrophy, as shown by ventricular enlargement on a CT or MRI scan, may be a predisposing 
factor for post -stroke depression.  Some studies have found no difference in the frequency 
of depression between patients with left and right hemisphere lesions, so this issue needs 
further investigation.  

%
Patients with cerebrovascular disease can experience mood disturbances  which are too 
brief to justify the diagnosis of organic mood syndrome.  These disturbances are referred 33 
 to as pathological emotionalism, or emotional lability, and their defining features are an 
increase in tearfulness with sudden episodes of crying which  are not under normal social 
control.  
 
%
There is a close relationship between the endocrine system and mood.  Endocrine diseases 
as a cause of psychological symptoms, including depression and anxiety, are well known.  
Anxiety symptoms  are prominent in hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma and 
hypoglycaemia due to an insulinoma.  The anxiety may be persistent or episodic, and in 
the case of pheochromocytoma the onset is so abrupt that it resembles an acute panic attack. 
Depression is a comm on accompaniment of hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome, 
Addison’s disease and hyperparathyroidism.  It is occasionally seen in hyperthyroidism in 
the elderly (‘apathetic thyrotoxicosis’) and in hypoparathyroidism.  
 
%
There have been intriguing reports of depression as a prodromal manifestation of cancer, 
although not all studies have found an association between the two conditions.  Several 
explanations have been proposed to account for the hypothetical link, the most likely being 
that t he generalized debilitating effects of cancer mimic the symptoms of depression to 
such an extent that a diagnosis of depression is made before the tumour becomes manifest.  
This would account for the alleged association between depression and pancreatic 
carcinoma, a tumour which is notoriously difficult to diagnose in its early stages.  
Depression may be an early presenting feature of a primary or secondary cerebral tumour. 

%  
Several non -metastatic neuropsychiatric syndromes have also been described, and th ey are 
believed to result from the effects on the nervous system of peptide substances secreted by 
the tumor. Non -metastatic metabolic changes can be responsible for depressive symptoms: 
carcinoma of the lung is known to secrete ectopic ACTH or parathormon e, giving rise to 
the clinical features of Cushing’s syndrome or hyperparathyroidism. Autoimmune 34 
 mechanisms in cancer can also cause limbic encephalitis, which is associated with 
behavioural and mood changes.  
It is also possible that an antecedent depressi ve illness can reduce the patient’s 
immunological competence. Chronic depression or stress impairs cell -mediated immunity, 
thus allowing the development and proliferation of malignant cells. Some studies have 
claimed that treating depression may prolong su rvival and reduce recurrences in patients 
with cancer.  
 
%
Neuropsychiatric features are being increasingly recognised in this groups of conditions 
which include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, polyarteritis 
nodosa and temporal arteritis.  Particular attention has been given to SLE, in which 
neuropsychiatric manifestations are one of the diagnostic criteria. Organic mental 
disturbances are the commonest psychological changes but depression and psychotic 
syndromes can  also occur.  Changes in cerebral blood flow in these patients and episodes 
of cerebral vasculitis alter blood flow and allow leakage of autoantibodies into brain tissue.  
 
% 
Depressive symptoms comprise one group of adverse drug  reactions which account for a 
considerable degree of psychiatric morbidity.  
Drug -induced psychiatric disorders may be divided as follows:  
• Behavioral toxicity: irritability, edginess, restlessness, aggressive outbursts, 
hostility and hypersexuality. These are psychological or behavioural symptoms 
which arise as side effects of psychotropic medications. If these features are 
considered to be arising out of depression, the dosage of medication may be 
enhanced, giving rise to more side effects and toxicity.  
%
• Delirium: Elderly subjects with delirium can be hypoactive, have disturbed sleep, 
and may be misdiagnosed as having depression. However, fluctuating 
consciousness, altered sleep cycles and cognitive i mpairments differentiate 
delirium from depression.  
%
 • Depressive reactions: varying from mild mood changes to severe psychotic 
depression. Some drugs can produce transient negative mood states (dysphoric 
reactions).  
%
• Paranoid and schizophrenia -like psychoses: delusions of persecution with or 
without auditory hallucinations; also thought disorders of the schizophrenic type, 
% 
• Hallucinatory states: usually visual without other features of delirium,  
%
• Dementia and cognitive impairment: cognitive changes usually are re versible on 
stopping the drug, though some drugs can produce irreversible brain damage,  

%
• Neuropsychiatric states: a combination of psychological symptoms with 
involuntary movements, ataxia, dysarthria or convulsions  
This list of drugs causing affective symp toms is lengthy.  


 
% 
If affective symptoms can be produced by produc ed by a wide range of physical disorders, 
which have not yet manifested themselves in other ways, it must be asked whether the 
physical process has a causal or precipitating effect.  Structural brain damage could have a 
direct causal effect, but in other c ases the relationship is not so clear.  36 
 In contrast, where depression or mania occurs as a result of drug, toxic or metabolic effects, 
the patients are likely to have a genetic or constitutional disposition to depression.  In these 
cause the physical disorder appears to precipitate episodes of m ood disturbance which may 
have arisen spontaneously or in response to other adverse factors.  
 
 %
Management of symptomatic depressive disorders    
Treatment is aimed at reversing the underlying condition and when this can be achieved 
the results are very satis factory.  In drug -induced conditions, stopping the offending agent 
may be all that is required.  Similarly, treating an infectious illness with antibiotics may be 
sufficient to relieve all accompanying depressive symptoms. If the underlying cause cannot 
be reversed, depression may still respond to antidepressant medication.  
 
%  
❖ Primary depressions are those which arise in and of themselves.  
❖ Secondary depressions follow in the train of some other illness or event.  
❖ Other classifications are endo genous or reactive and psychotic or neurotic.  
❖ Symptomatic depressive disorders often occur in people who are unaware that they 
are physically ill.  
❖ Mood disorders should be suspected of being symptomatic of an underlying 
physical illness in certain circumst ances,  
❖ Depression due to illness, viz, endocrine disorders, cancer, collagen disease is also 
fairly common.  
❖ Drug induced depression is seen with antihpertensives, corticosteroids, major 
tranquilizers, leveodopa, stimulants (withdeawal),  


%
The life -time prevalence of depression is twice as high in women as in men.  The 
reproductive years in women are one of the greatest risk periods for the development of 
depression. Mood changes have been found to be associated with reproduct ive life events 
such as menarche, the premenstrual period, menopause, pregnancy, childbirth, oral 
contraceptive usage, tubal ligation, abortion, and infertility.  Let us discuss depression in 
relation to some of these reproductive life events, or situations. 
 
 
%
Traditionally, adolescent girls  in Indian homes are given little or no information about 
menstruation before their first menstrual period.  This event, referred to as “coming of age”, 
is considered a special event in many communities. As a result, most young girls are 
unprepared for the menarche and may perceive this event as being stressful.  Depression, 
worry and transient thoughts of danger to one's health are common emotional responses.  
Much depends on how the adolesce nt is able to accept her experience - as a negative one 
or a positive one.  Invariably, depression related to menarche is short -lasting and is 
overcome by information provided by womenfolk in the household and peer group.  It 
rarely requires antidepressant  therapy.  Physicians may be called upon to counsel 
adolescents at times, when there is a need to provide them with accurate information about 
reproductive functioning.  
 
% 
Premenstrual tension or syndrome related depression  
Most women are aware of premenstrual physiological and emotional changes.  Typically 
these premenstrual changes are mild, do not interfere with day to day functioning, do not 
require medical intervention, and are considered “normal”. However, about 5 -10% 
women suffer from moderate to severe depression, often associated with irritability, 
during the premenstrual period, which tends to recur over consecutive cycles.  Low 
mood, weepiness, increased sensitivity, irritability, and depressive thoughts appear 5 or  6 
days before the onset of the periods, and are often accompanied by features of water 
retention, such as a sense of bloating, weight gain or ankle swelling.  Typically, these 38 
 subside with the onset of menstruation.  No features of depression or irritabil ity are 
reported during other days of the cycle.  

%
Confirmation of premenstrual depression requires examining women at different times of 
the month, to observe fluctuations in behavior, mood and physical symptoms. Sometimes, 
it is helpful to ask women to mai ntain a diary in order to make the relationship between 
menstrual cycle phases and symptom exacerbations.  

% 
Menopause      
Psychological and emotional symptoms which occur during menopause are thought to be 
due to decreased ovarian activity, sociocultural factors, and psychological fac tors.  
Menopause is a natural process, a positive experience, and a normal reproductive life 
cycle event which normally presents few difficulties, but the effect of psychosocial 
factors is complex. Most women do not seek medical help for menopause, though for 
working and professional women it is timed at the peak of their careers. Sociocultural 
factors affect the experience of menopause.  Menopausal symptoms are increased in 
women of lower, socioeconomic status, especially those with low self -satisfaction a nd 
low self -esteem. 

% 
A natural menopause does not have adverse psychological consequences for the majority 
of middle -aged healthy women.  Though the commonest reason why women seek treatment 
for menopause is physical complaints, such as hot flashes, some wo men do develop 
significant depression. Depressive symptoms during the menopause commonly include 
sadness, slowness, excessive concerns about the future and multiple physical or somatic 
complaints.  Many times women may complain of only physical complaints – like 
weakness, aches and pains in different parts, tiredness etc, rather than sadness or disinterest 
in surroundings. Physicians and gynaecologists must be alert to the possibility of 39 
 depression, and screen for it appropriately rather than dismissing a w oman's complaints as 
“normal” or unimportant.   

%
Pregnancy related  depression  
Depression is more often related to an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy than to a desired 
and planned pregnancy. Depression during pregnancy may thus be reactive in nature, and 
mild.  In primiparous women, it could be related to the anxiety about childbirth, as well as 
survival and welfare of th e foetus.  The use of modern technology in the prenatal period, 
though it reduces risks, can stimulate anxiety about abnormalities.

%
 Sometimes, depression 
could be due to first trimester complications, such as hyperemesis.  Obviously, medications 
should be avoided as much as possible during the first trimester, due to risk of congenital 
malformations.  During the second and third trimester, depression can be safely treated by 
a judicious use of antidepressants and counseling or psychotherapy. Antidepressants  
should also be withheld prior to delivery, if possible, as they cross the placenta during 
labour and can cause neonatal complications.  
 
% 
Post partum depressive disorders  
Post partum depression, also called postnatal or puerperal depression, covers a spect rum 
from mild emotional setbacks to profound disruptions requiring psychiatric 
hospitalization.  Those disorders are fairly common, largely go undetected and are 
generally treatable.  Though the causes of postpartum depression are not well understood, 
it is thought that multiple factors – physical, psychological, hormonal and social - 
contribute to the genesis and maintenance of postpartum depression. Depressive 
symptoms following delivery may take on various forms: 
%
 Postpartum blues  
Postpartum blues are com mon, experienced by 50 -80% of women following delivery. 
Symptoms are mild and short lived, but 20 -25% progress to postpartum depression.  They 
usually begin on the 3rd day following delivery, may last from may last from a few minutes 
to several days, and a re self limited and benign. Full resolution usually occurs within 2 
weeks.  

%
Postpartum blues are characterized by crying, depressed mood, mood lability (including 
euphoria, tearfulness, anxiety and irritability), sleeplessness, restlessness, loss of appeti te, 
fatigue, apathy, physical complaints, headache, excessive dreaming, nightmares and hostile 
thoughts or feelings towards the baby or other children. Women may feel overwhelmed by 
their responsibilities, may lack confidence and sometimes feel that they c annot cope with 
their baby.  

%
Postpartum blues are widely considered a “normal” phenomenon, though in individual 
cases, physical, emotional or social stressors may worsen or prolong their duration. Sleep 
deprivation can aggravate the blues. No specific mana gement is needed, except for 
education regarding the benign and harmless nature of the symptoms, and support and 
validation of the patient's experiences.  

%
Women who seem overly anxious or who are preoccupied with thoughts of harming their 
babies, who have a  past or family history of mental illness, or whose symptoms persist 
beyond 2 weeks should be referred to a psychiatrist, since these mild disturbances may 
escalate into more serious disorders.  
 
%  
Depressive disorders during the postpartum period are similar to depression which occurs 
at other times.  Childbirth functions as a precipitating factor or nonspecific stress. Up to 
10-25% of women experience one or more episodes of postpartum depression.  
Risk factors include a past history of depression, depression during pregnancy, an 
unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, early or late motherhood, marital discord or 
dissatisfaction, poor coping skills, and poor social adjustment.  Stress factors like economic 
hardship and isolation may contribute t o depression.   
%
 Early or prodromal symptoms include excessive anxiety, irritability, crying and severe 
sleep disturbances.  Sleep may be reduced and irregular because of the baby’s sleep -wake 
pattern, but if the sleeplessness persists even when the baby is  sleeping, this is indicative 
of significant insomnia.  

%
The risk of postpartum depression begins in the first week after childbirth but symptoms 
may appear after weeks or months.  Typically, symptoms appear by the 4th - 6th week.  
Unfortunately, most women with postpartum depression never come to medical attention, 
and may go undetected and untreated.  Many consult their general practitioners of family 
physicians even routinely during the postpartum period.  Therefore, general practitioners 
have a crucial ro le in identifying women with postpartum depression.  
Other reasons for lack of detection of postpartum depression include:  
• Young mothers are shy or ashamed of their feelings and fear criticism for being 
depressed when then they are expected to be happy.  
• Practitioners confuse transient blues with clinical depression.  
• Many believe that postpartum depression is a social problem reflecting the 
changing role of women or that it is self -limiting.  
• Practitioners are primarily occupied with the health and w ell being of the baby, 
rather than of the mother.  
 
% 
Signs and symptoms of postpartum depression  
These are varied, but often include sad mood, fatigue, confusion, poor concentration, 
irritability, crying, insomnia, feeling of inadequacy and difficulty in cop ing, guilt over not 
loving the baby enough, and severe anxiety.  There is excessive concern about the baby’s 
health, feeling, or safety and intense preoccupation with the details of infant’s care. 
Recurring thoughts occur that the baby is abnormal or will die and fears that one may 
accidentally or willfully  harm the baby are common.  

%
Untreated postpartum depression has serious consequences. There is a small but significant 
risk of both suicide and infanticide, especially in severe or psychotic depression. In  
addition, poor mother -infant bonding during the first months of a child's life can cause 
lifelong developmental, cognitive, emotional and behavioural problems. Thus, it is 42 
 essential that postpartum depression should be recognized and treated as early as p ossible, 
to minimize the risk of such complications  

%
Treatment includes counseling and antidepressant medications.  If psychotropic drugs are 
used, breast -feeling should be avoid ed for at least 4 -5 hours after a dose of medication. 
However, most available a ntidepressants do not pose a major threat to the nursing infant, 
and since breastfeeding has health benefits for both mother and baby, it should not be 
interrupted unless absolutely necessary.  
Regarding the prevention of postpartum depression, women as we ll as physicians and 
gynaecologists can be educated about symptoms and risk factors for the development of 
postpartum depression and this can facilitate early referral, less postpartum depression, and 
better outcome.  

%
Postpartum psychotic depression is an e mergency that requires hospitalization and 
intensive treatment by a psychiatrist at an inpatient psychiatric facility, to prevent harm to 
both mother and baby.  
 
To Recapitulate …  
❖ The reproductive years in women are one of the greatest risk periods for 
development of depression  
❖ Mood changes are associated with events like menarche, the premenstrual period, 
menopause, pregnancy, oral contraceptive usage, tubal ligation, the postpartum 
period, abortion and infertility.  
❖ Antidepressants are helpful in alleviati ng depression and anxiety symptoms.  
❖ It is safer to use a drug with fewer side effects.

Depressed mood as a reaction to loss or stress is quite common in children, although this 
is not always evident due to a child’s more limited vocabulary and cognitive abilities.  
Because the child is in a continual process of development, the expression of depressions 
in children will be conditioned by each particular stage of development and can manifest 
itself in in variou s ways, because the repertoire of cognitive and affective behaviour is 
limited.  This raises the problem of “depressive equivalents” or “masked depression” 
especially among adolescents.  Sadness, crying, inhibition, guilt are absent or rare, and 
other symp toms like conduct problems or somatic symptoms may be the presenting 
complaint.  
The common causes of depression in childhood are bereavement, loss, or significant life 
stressors such as family disputes or problems in academic and peer group settings.  Usua lly, 
children may manifest depression in the following ways:  

% 
Masked depression  
This is most the frequent type of depression. Typical clinical features include hyperactivity, 
aggressive behaviour, delinquency, school refusal, an unexplained decline in academic 
performance, reduced socialization or interest in play, psychosomatic illness, and 
psychogenic pain.  In adolescents, a mixture of conduct, depressive and anxiety symptoms 
is common – the so -called “depressive conduct disorder” or “mixed disorder of conduct 
and emotions”. In some adolescents, depression may present with marked psychotic 
symptoms, and be misdiagnosed as schizophrenia.  

%
Pure depressive syndrome  
This includes symptoms similar to those seen in adults: persistent sad effect, crying spel ls, 
social withdrawal, hopelessness, helplessness, helplessness, and lack of interest in school, 
games or extracurricular activities.  
Common non -specific symptoms of depression in children are irritability, weepiness, 
sadness, tension, moodiness, difficult y in falling asleep and abdominal pain.  Enuresis and 
school refusal are also commonly noted in younger children with depression.  44 
 In the background, there may be a family history of affective illness (depression, mania) or 
alcoholism.  
 
%
Depression is seen often in elderly people.  Late -life depression is often complicated by a 
number of factors, like aging, physical illnesses, multiple medications for medical i llnesses, 
social isolation, retirement and financial difficulties, family stresses, etc. Though elderly 
individuals are able to cope better, they also face more stresses, and the occurrence of 
physical illness reduce their coping strength.  Some of the com mon factors which 
contribute to depression in old age are:  
Medical illnesses  
A number of medical illnesses are age -related.  Hypertension, diabetes and osteoarthritis 
are the commonest.  These illnesses themselves produce a reactive depression in the 
individual.  The person’s inability to look after himself, or incapacitation, contributes to 
depressive  feelings and thoughts.  Moreover, medications and dietary restrictions can 
worsen depression.  
 
% 
“Vascular depression” is the term given to a special form of symptomatic depression that 
occurs in medically ill, elderly individuals. It is the result of multiple small strokes 
involving subcortical regions of the brain, which leads to depressed mood, psychomotor 
retardation, and slowness  of thought and speech. Patients may have a history of strokes or 
transient ischaemic attacks, and often have vascular risk factors such as diabetes, 
hypertension, obesity, hyperlipidaemia, or cigarette smoking. As it may progress to 
dementia if untreated,  these patients require aggressive control of their cardiovascular 
disorders with drugs such as antiplatelet agents and antihypertensives.  
 
% 
As age advances, more responsibilities have to be shouldered by the individual.  There 
may be marriag es and other rituals to be performed for children or grandchildren.  
Demands on finances increase, whereas the individual would have attained retirement.  46 
 Similarly, the need for education of children or grandchildren may also impose a burden 
on ageing pare nts.  The elderly are often subjected to ill -treatment and isolated due to their 
physical or mental debility.  
 
%
Depression in old age manifests in a similar manner as is seen in younger age groups.  It 
may seem milder i n intensity at many times, but severe agitated depression, often with 
psychotic symptoms is also noted. Such severe late -life depression has been called 
“involutional melancholia”.  Feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness and helplessness are 
common.  A la ck of interest in surroundings and a lack of pleasure from usual activities is 
more commonly noted than sadness or weeping spells.  The person finds it difficult to cope 
with the domestic, financial and social stresses mentioned above.  

%
Sleep reduces as age  advances, so sleeplessness due to depression has to be distinguished 
from the insomnia of old age.  Usually, the depressed person would report a change in 
pattern of sleep, amount of sleep, and not feeling refreshed from sleep.  
Appetite may be reduced wit h weight loss.  Loss of appetite and weight in this age group 
may cause concern to their physicians, who might suspect a malignancy.  Libido would 
also be low and part of it could be age related.  

%
Another important point to note is that some elderly depress ed patients may complain 
chiefly of memory loss or loss of mental function, though their underlying problem is 
depression. This condition is often misdiagnosed as dementia, and hence is known as 
depressive pseudodementia , or dementia syndrome of depression . It is important to 
recognize this “masked” form of depression, because treating it can cause a complete 
recovery of cognitive deficits.  


%
Depressive disorders produce great morbidity and mortality if left untreated.  Moderate to 
severe depression can have adverse effects on a number of spheres of life for the depressed 
person and his family.  Some of the consequences are listed below:  
• Suicidal attempts and completed suicides  
• Occupational a nd financial loss due to feeling low, depressed, slowed down or 
disinterest in work.  
• Inability to work due to difficulty in attention and concentration.   
• Sedative – hypnotic abuse for sleep disturbance,  
• Alcohol abuse and dependence.  Dependence on other d rugs like cannabis, 
amphetamines.  
• Frequent consultation for physical symptoms.  Unnecessary investigations and 
consultations.  
• Increased vulnerability to common medical illnesses like infections and severe 
diseases like cancer.  
• Complications due to antidepr essant medications.  
• Patients may switch over to hypomania or mania because of the underlying or 
undetected bipolar nature of their affective disorder.  
• Social consequences due to withdrawal and lack of interest in socialising or 
meeting people.  This can d isrupt interpersonal relationships and can even lead 
to marital discord or separation.  
• Deliberate self -harm in terms of injuring or hurting oneself as a suicidal gesture, 
or in order to hurt oneself as a ‘deserved punishment’.  Irritability and 
aggression toward family members may also occur, especially in psychotic or 
agitated depression.  
Let us now discuss some of the common and important complications of depression.  50 

%
Most depressed patients will either recover completely or nearly so form the first attack 
(70-92%). Some of this group will have a fairly rapid recurrence of minor affective 
symptoms. Episodes occurring later i n life last longer and are possibly more likely to be 
chronic. Sex and family history of affective disorder do not influence duration, but slow 
onset may indicate slow recovery.  
A majority of those who recover will relapse. There may be a subpopulation of those who 
do not relapse, who are much more likely to be depressive than manic. Some have claimed 
that the chance of recovery becomes less with succeeding episodes.  
A substantial  minority develop a chronic disability which may follow the first episode. The 
proportion of chronic cases increases with intensity of follow -up. Between 5 and 10% may 
be long -term hospital inpatients and an additional 25% may have persistent affective 
symptoms which are to some degree incapacitating. There is considerable social 
impairment in this group.  
 

%
Depression is much worse than simple unhappiness. Major de -
pression (also called clinical depression) is a mood disorder . This 
means that a person ’s emotional state is abnormally low or sad, 
and the person cannot independently raise his or her mood. The 
chief symptom of major depression is a sad, despairing mood that 
persists beyond two weeks and impairs a person ’s performance 
at work, at school or in social relationships. This profoundly low 
mood state can be confusing because some of the symptoms of 
depression are behavioural, such as moving or talking slowly, while 
others are emotional and cognitive, such as feeling hopeless and 
thinking negative thoughts. This is very different from the physical 
symptoms of other illnesses, like the pain of a broken leg or the 
fever from a serious infection. 

%
Depression is more common in women, though the sex difference 
diminishes with increasing age in Canada. Depression is most com -
mon in people between the ages of 15 and 45.
HOW IS DEPRESSION DIAGNOSED? 
In making a diagnosis, a doctor will ask you if you have experienced 
any of the following:
• changes in appetite and weight
• sleep problems, either sleeping too much or too little
•  loss of interest in work, hobbies, people; loss of feeling for family 
members and friends
• feelings of uselessness, hopelessness, excessive guilt
•  preoccupation with failure(s) or inadequacies and a loss of self-  
esteem; certain thoughts that are obsessional and difficult to 
“turn off”3 Understanding depression
•  agitation or loss of energy; feelings of restlessness, or being too 
tired and weak to do anything
•  slowed thinking, forgetfulness, trouble concentrating and making 
decisions
• decreased sexual drive
•  a tendency to cry easily, or having the urge to cry but being unable 
to do so
• suicidal or occasionally homicidal thoughts
•  in some cases, a loss of touch with reality, perhaps hearing voices 
(hallucinations) or having strange ideas (delusions).
%


Depressive disorders can vary in severity. A person who experiences 
fewer than five of the symptoms of major depression for two weeks 
or more is diagnosed with minor depression. When someone experi -
ences five or more of these typical symptoms for at least two weeks, 
this is called a “major depressive episode.” For many people, how -
ever, their struggle with depression has persisted for weeks, months 
or even years before they visit a doctor or mental health care provid -
er. It is not uncommon for people to try to cope on their own while 
feeling their mood “slipping” or “dropping,” until it reaches a point 
that feels intolerable. People struggling with depression may also 
find themselves to be much more sensitive to comments from oth -
ers, and they get little or no relief when loved ones and friends try to 
cheer them up or offer support. 

%

The length of a depressive episode is influenced by the person ’s abil -
ity or willingness to get treatment. A treated depressive episode may 
only last for two to six weeks; however, untreated episodes may last 
six to 18 months or longer. The average is about five months.4

%
Depression also occurs in bipolar disorder  (formerly known as 
manic-depressive illness). Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder, 
but is characterized by episodes of mania  as well as episodes of 
depression. A person with mania will typically have an inflated or 
grandiose perception of his or her own importance or power. This 
can result in excessive involvement in activities that can lead to 
painful consequences (e.g., foolish business investments, shop -
ping sprees, sexual indiscretions). People with mania may also 
have less need for sleep, a pattern of very rapid speech and racing 
thoughts. 

%
During a manic episode, many people are unaware that 
their behaviour is unusual. Before a manic episode, however, peo -
ple generally experience a hypomanic phase , where they exhibit 
some less severe symptoms of mania (e.g., sleep disruption, a rac -
ing feeling), and are aware that they may be heading toward a full 
manic episode. This insight allows them to seek medical interven -
tion and possibly avert a full-blown manic episode. 
While they share similar symptoms of depression, bipolar disor -
der and major depression are separate disorders requiring differ -
ent treatment. Because of this, it is important for patients, family 
members and health care providers to watch for signs of mania 
or hypomania in people experiencing depression. Other warning 
signs for the presence of bipolar disorder include: 
• depression that begins in the teenage years
•  certain kinds of depression ( atypical depression , seasonal de -
pression, postpartum depression, and possibly depression with 
psychosis), whose symptoms may all sometimes occur as part  
of bipolar disorder. 


%
Different kinds of depression
Major depression is broken down into subtypes, each with a slight -
ly different set of symptoms. It is important to receive an accurate 
diagnosis, because different types of depression may respond bet -
ter to different types of treatments. 

%
In addition to the general features of depression, people with typical 
symptoms of depression tend to experience sleep difficulties (trouble 
falling asleep, sleeping less than usual, and/or frequent waking 
through the night), decreased appetite, and weight loss.
People with atypical symptoms  share the general features of major 
depression, but some symptoms are reversed: they tend to oversleep, 
eat more  than normal and gain weight. In addition: 
• symptoms of anxiety  are often present
•  evening rather than morning tends to be the hardest part of the day 
• arms or legs may feel heavy and leaden 
•  the person may be highly sensitive to feelings of rejection (even 
when not feeling depressed).

While a person with typical symptoms is generally unresponsive, 
atypical depression is characterized by “mood reactivity.” This means 
that a person will be able to respond positively to something good or 
a pleasurable event, such as a visit from a relative, but will quickly 
become depressed again when the source of this pleasure disap -
pears. These shifts up and down can be very difficult both for the 
person and for family members. Understanding depression6
Depression: An information guide
Atypical depression tends to be more common in teenagers and 
young adults.

Seasonal affective disorder  (sad) is a type of depression in which 
mood tends to be affected by the weather and time of the year. 
Symptoms usually occur during the fall and winter, and the per -
son feels better during the spring and summer. People struggling 
with sad usually experience several symptoms, including several-
months-long sad mood, increased sleep and increased appetite, 
characterized by carbohydrate cravings and weight gain. Women 
experience sad four times more than men.

%
sad is more common in northern climates, where there is a signifi -
cant decrease in the hours of sunlight over the winter months. It is 
not unusual for anyone to experience some changes in mood dur -
ing periods of decreased sunlight. However, people with sad will 
experience much more severe symptoms that interfere with their 
ability to work and relate well to others, though the symptoms of sad 
are generally less severe than those of major depression.

%
POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
While all types of depression may have multiple causes, postpartum 
depression  follows a specific event, the birth of a child. Its onset may 
be related to biochemical and hormonal changes, emotional issues 
and social circumstances. Upwards of 10 per cent of women will 
experience this type of depression, which is characterized by the ma -
jor symptoms of depression that persist for four weeks or more and 
interfere with a mother’s social and emotional functioning. Postpar -7
tum depression differs from the more common and less severe post -
partum blues, which many women experience after childbirth.

% 
Women who have had depressive episodes before pregnancy may 
be more vulnerable to developing a postpartum depression. Emo -
tional issues, such as whether the baby was planned or unplanned, 
or whether the mother has support from the father and extended 
family, may also contribute to the onset of a depression. The respon -
sibility of a new infant combined with the symptoms of depression 
can make this a very difficult time socially. Family and friends may 
wonder how the mother of a new baby could not be feeling joy on 
such a happy occasion. This may make the new mother experiencing 
depression feel more isolated and uncomfortable in coming forward 
to ask for help. 

%
DEPRESSION WITH PSYCHOSIS
In some cases, depression may become so severe that a person 
loses touch with reality and becomes psychotic. Psychosis involves 
a break with reality in which a person experiences hallucinations  
(hearing voices or seeing people or objects that are not really there) 
or delusions  (beliefs that have no basis in reality). Delusions may be 
paranoid, such as when the person believes that others are plotting 
against him or her. Hallucinations and delusions may be very critical 
or negative, and this may make the depressive state worse. When a 
person with depression also has psychotic symptoms, treatment in -
volves both antidepressant and antipsychotic medications.

DYSTHYMIA
Dysthymia, or dysthymic disorder , describes a chronically low mood 
with some moderate symptoms of depression, such as poor appetite 
or overeating, inability to sleep or sleeping too much, low energy or  Understanding depression8
Depression: An information guide
fatigue, low self-esteem, poor concentration, difficulty making 
decisions and feelings of hopelessness. If two or more of these 
symptoms last for two or more years, and a person does not ex -
perience a major depressive episode during this time, then a di -
agnosis of dysthymia may be made. While not as severe as major 
depression, dysthymia can interfere with a person ’s functioning 
at work, at school or in important relationships. A person may 
have dysthymia, and then experience a major depressive episode. 
This is known as double depression . 

%
Personality disorders and depression
Sometimes, people with depression may also be told by a doctor or 
psychologist that they have a personality disorder . What does this 
mean, and how does it affect the depression? Personality is what 
makes up the whole of the person, including thoughts, feelings, 
actions and relationships with others. A personality trait refers to 
the identifiable patterns of individuals; their usual ways of thinking 
and feeling, their habitual behaviours and their characteristic ways 
of relating to others.

%
A personality disorder is a statement about the person ’s personality 
traits. It means that the person is seen to have patterns of thoughts 
and feelings, behaviours and relationship styles that differ in sig -
nificant ways from the culture in which he or she lives. Not only do 
these patterns differ from the norm, but they also lead the person 
to feel bad about himself or herself and interfere with his or her 
ability to function well at work and in his or her personal life.
A person will be diagnosed with a specific type of personality dis -
order. For example, a person diagnosed as having a paranoid per -
sonality disorder will have problems trusting others in most parts 9
of his or her life, even when there is no basis for suspicions. This 
pervasive distrust complicates the treatment of depression, because 
it interferes with the person ’s ability to develop and maintain re -
lationships with others who might be able to provide needed sup -
port, including a doctor or mental health care provider. 

%
Many people have some of these personality characteristics, without 
any significant interference in their lives. For example, if someone is 
slow to trust, but is able to gain a belief in the goodwill of one or two 
friends or family members over time, we would think of this quality 
as being a personality trait, but not one that keeps the person from 
engaging in a satisfying life. This person would not be diagnosed as 
having a personality disorder.
%
Other examples of personality disorders are schizoid (great difficulty 
attaching emotionally to others), borderline (a pattern of unstable 
relationships, with impulsive and sometimes self-destructive behav -
iour), and obsessive-compulsive (perfectionist, focused on minute 
details to the exclusion of others’ thoughts and opinions). (Obses -
sive-compulsive personality  disorder is different from obsessive-
compulsive disorder, which is an anxiety disorder characterized by 
repeated unwanted thoughts and repetitive behaviours aimed at 
reducing anxiety.)
%
While personality disorders differ in how they manifest in each 
person, they all get in the way of people living comfortably with 
themselves or others. A person struggling with depression and a 
personality disorder not only needs to feel better, but also needs 
to learn new ways of relating to the world. This person ’s treatment 
will likely include both medication and psychotherapy .Understanding depression2 What causes depression?
There is no simple answer to what causes depression, because 
several factors may play a part in the onset of the disorder. These 
include a genetic or family history of depression, psychological or 
emotional vulnerability to depression, biological factors, and life 
event or environmental stressors.

% The fact that you may be under -
taking one type of treatment, for example antidepressant medica -
tion, does not mean your depression is entirely biological. What 
it does mean is that often depression can be effectively treated by 
focusing on one area, such as the biochemistry in the brain. The 
type of treatment recommended is also often influenced by the 
severity of your depression. If someone is severely depressed, it 
is difficult for the person to undertake the “talking therapies.” As 
a result, medication may be the first stage of treatment, followed 
by psychotherapy as a second stage of intervention. Once you are 
feeling somewhat better, you may be better able to tolerate talking 
about other life problems that contribute to your depression. 
Everyone has a certain number of “risk” or “vulnerability” factors. 

%

A family history of depression does not necessarily mean that chil -
dren or other relatives will develop major depression. However, 
people with a family history of depression have a slightly higher 
chance of becoming depressed at some stage in their lives. There 
are several theories to explain this phenomenon.

%
Genetic research suggests that depression can run in families. Stud -
ies of twins raised separately have shown that if one twin develops 
the disorder, the other has a 40 to 50 per cent chance of also being 
affected. This rate, though it is moderate, suggests that some people 
may have a genetic predisposition to developing depression. 
A genetic predisposition alone, however, is unlikely to cause de -
pression.

%
 Other factors, such as traumatic childhood or adult life 
events, may act as triggers. The onset of depression may also be 
influenced by what we learn as children. Some people may have 
been exposed to the depressive symptoms of their parents and have 
learned this as a way of reacting to certain problems. As adults, 
they may go on to use these strategies to deal with their own life 
stressors. Growing up with one parent who has been depressed 
puts a child at a 10 per cent risk of developing the disorder. If both 
parents were depressed, there is a 30 per cent risk. These figures 
are lower than those for other types of illness that may be passed on 
from parent to child .

%
Personality style, and the way you have learned to deal with prob -
lems, may contribute to the onset of depression. If you are the type 
of person who has a low opinion of yourself and worries a lot, if 
you are overly dependent on others, if you are a perfectionist and 
expect too much from yourself or others, or if you tend to hide your 
feelings, you may be at greater risk of becoming depressed.


%
Some studies suggest that early childhood trauma and losses—
such as the death or separation of parents—or adult life events—
such as the death of a loved one, divorce, the loss of a job, retire -
ment, serious financial problems, or family conflict—can lead to 
the onset of depression. Experiencing several severe and prolonged 
difficult life events increases a person ’s chances of developing a 
depressive disorder. Once depressed, it is common for a person to 
remember earlier traumatic life events, such as the loss of a par -
ent or childhood abuse, which make the depression worse.

%
Living with chronic family problems can also seriously affect a 
person ’s mood and lead to depressive symptoms. People living in 
emotionally abusive or violent relationships can feel trapped, both 
financially and emotionally, and feel hopeless about their future. 
This is particularly true of mothers with young children. The ongo -
ing stress and social isolation associated with these family circum -
stances can lead to depressive symptoms.13
Once a person develops a serious depression, he or she may need 
intensive treatment before feeling able to deal with the situation or 
life stressors that triggered the onset of the illness. 


% 
Depression may appear after unusual physiological changes such 
as childbirth, and viral or other infections. This has given rise to 
the theory that hormonal or chemical imbalances in the brain 
may cause depression. Studies have shown that there are differ -
ences in the levels of certain biochemicals between people who are 
depressed and those who are not. The fact that depression can be 
helped by antidepressant medication and brain intervention thera -
pies tends to support this theory. 

%
Seasonal affective disorder ( sad) is a good example of how biol -
ogy and personality may work together to influence the onset of 
depression. Researchers are investigating whether chemicals in 
the brain that regulate mood, sleep and appetite are affected by 
changes in levels of light. Research has found that people expe -
riencing sad seem to be highly sensitive to their own feelings and 
events around them, and that these reactions are amplified by sea -
sonal changes in light levels.

%
For many people with depression and their families, trying to un -
derstand the various theories that explain the onset of depression 
can be very confusing. While research has yet to fully explain the 
causes of depression, it is important to know that effective treat -
ments are still available.

%
Changes in the hormonal cycle of women have been linked with 
symptoms of depression. Before their monthly periods (premen -
strual stage), women can experience changeable moods, irritability, 
anxiety, sleep difficulties, as well as abdominal cramps, bloating 
and breast tenderness. For women with premenstrual tension , 
these symptoms may last for a few days and then go away. For 
those with premenstrual syndrome  (pms), the symptoms are more 
severe, and disrupt routine activities. A woman who struggles with 
both depression and premenstrual symptoms tends to feel much 
worse during this time of the month. 

%
During menopause , a period of biological changes during mid-life, 
women must adjust to the effects of reduced levels of the hormone 
estrogen. The symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes and 
profound sweating, may make it harder to function at work and in 
social situations. Menopause is also a time when women may have 
to deal with psychological issues and other life events—children 
may be leaving home, and aging spouses and family members 
may develop health problems. Menopause also represents the end 
of a woman ’s ability to have children. The physical and emotional 
stressors associated with menopause may contribute to the onset 
of depressive symptoms. 

%
In people with a physical illness, depression can occur in three 
different ways. Depressive symptoms may be the result of another 
illness  that shares the same symptoms, such as lupus or hypothy -
roidism. Depression may be a reaction to another illness , such as 
cancer or a heart attack. Finally, depression may be caused by an 
illness itself , such as a stroke, where neurological changes have oc -
curred. Regardless of the cause, depression in people with a physi -
cal illness is often treated with antidepressants and other therapies.


%
Yes. Generally, older adults are given lower dosages of antidepres -
sants because they are more sensitive to medication, prone to con -
fusion, and may have more trouble tolerating side-effects. Potential 
drug interactions must be considered, because older patients are 
often also taking medication for other medical problems.

%
Alcohol, street drugs and some prescription medications can pro -
vide a temporary break from some of the symptoms of depression. 
However, this “self-medication ” simply masks —and sometimes 
worsens —the symptoms of depression, which resurface when the 
substance use stops. In some people, depression can be triggered  
by abuse of alcohol and other drugs. In both cases, the substance 
abuse itself can lead to further health problems and can disrupt 
a person ’s ability to function. In most cases, treatment for the What causes depression?16
Depression: An information guide
substance abuse is given first. If the depression persists, then the 
mood disorder becomes the focus of intervention.

%
As many as two-thirds of people with depression also have 
prominent symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety refers to excessive worry 
that is hard to control (apprehensive expectation). A person with 
anxiety feels restless, keyed up or on edge. The person may also tire 
easily; feel his or her mind going blank; feel irritable; or have tense 
muscles, trouble concentrating and sleep problems. The combina -
tion of depressive and anxiety symptoms can severely impair a per -
son ’s ability to function at work, at school and in relationships. 

%
If you have symptoms of both depression and anxiety, a thorough 
assessment should determine which of the two is the primary 
problem. The diagnosis will influence what kind of treatment is 
suggested. If it is difficult to tell which is the primary disorder, a 
diagnosis of mixed anxiety-depressive disorder will be made, and 
treatment will be prescribed accordingly.
%
Many of the medications used to treat depression, such as citalopram 
(Celexa), escitalopram (Cipralex), sertraline (Zoloft), venlafaxine 
(Effexor), duloxetine (Cymbalta) and desvenlafaxine (Pristiq) also 
treat anxiety. A person might also benefit from an anti-anxiety 
medication or anxiolytic  such as lorazepam (Ativan). Cognitive-
behavioural therapy, a short-term talk therapy described in the next 
chapter, has been very effective in treating both depression and 
anxiety. Other helpful treatments include relaxation therapy, and 
stress management techniques.17

%
Even though loneliness and a lack of social supports can contribute 
to and maintain depression, some people with depression want to 
be left alone. The symptoms of depression make socializing and 
interacting with friends and family very difficult and even stress -
ful. Additionally, people who are depressed often feel guilty about 
it, and assume that their presence cannot be tolerated by others. 
Unfortunately, the resulting social isolation simply reinforces their 
depression. Part of recovery involves encouraging people with 
depression to gradually reintroduce themselves to social situations 
and structured group activities.

 Depression During and After Pregnancy 
What Causes Perinatal Depression? 
There are a number of reasons why you may get depressed. As a 
woman, your body undergoes many changes during and after 
pregnancy. You may experience mood swings (feeling up, then 
down). A new baby will change your sleeping schedule and your 
lifestyle. You may also feel pressures to be the perfect mother. 
Perinatal Depression can happen to some women who have family 
members with depression, or who have had depression in their own 
past. And for some women, the cause is unclear. But for every woman 
who suffers Perinatal Depression, the causes are as unique as she is.

%
Perinatal Depression – It’s More Than the Baby Blues 
Many new 
mothers experience the Baby Blues. This is a very common 
reaction during the first few days after delivery. Symptoms include 
crying, worrying, sadness, anxiety, mood swings, trouble 
concentrating, difficulty sleeping, and not feeling yourself. 
The Baby Blues is not the same as Perinatal Depression and does 
not require medical attention. With time, patience, and the 
support of family and friends, symptoms linked with the Baby Blues 
will usually disappear within a few days or within 1 to 2 weeks. If 
they don’t, it may be a sign of a bigger problem, and you should seek 
medical help. 

 
 
 
 
%
Perinatal Depression can affect any woman—regardless of age, race, 
ethnicity, income, culture, or education. It affects women who 
breastfeed and those who don’t. It affects women with healthy babies 
and those whose children are ill. It affects first-time mothers and 
those with more than one child. It affects women who are married and 
those who are not. Women who had problems during pregnancy— 
and those who didn’t—may experience depression. Because Perinatal 
Depression is a health problem, it is not the fault of any woman. 
%
A family 
history of depression or bipolar disorder, a history of alcohol 
or substance misuse or abuse, a recent stressful event, relationship or 
financial problems, or a previous pregnancy with Perinatal Depression 
increases a woman’s chances of having Perinatal Depression.

%
Types of Perinatal Depression 
Even before the arrival of the baby, some women experience Depression 
During Pregnancy. Pregnant women commonly face a large number 
of challenges, including morning sickness, weight gain, and mood 
swings. Symptoms such as feeling really tired, appetite changes and 
poor sleep are often dismissed as “just part of pregnancy,” but if the 
things you do every day are affected, you should consider seeking 
help.  Whether the pregnancy was planned or unexpected, the changes 
that your body and emotions go through during pregnancy are very 
real—and so is the risk of Perinatal Depression during this time.

   
 
 %
One in seven women suffers a form of Perinatal Depression after 
birth known as Postpartum Depression. Symptoms can begin 
any time in the first year after giving birth. 
Common symptoms for Perinatal 
Depression (either during or after 
pregnancy) include:
•Sad feelings
•Feeling very anxious or worrying too much
•Being irritable or cranky
•Trouble sleeping (even when tired) or sleeping too much
•Trouble concentrating or remembering things
•Trouble making decisions
•Loss of interest in caring for yourself (for example, dressing,  
bathing, fixing hair)
•Loss of interest in food, or overeating
•Not feeling up to doing everyday tasks
•Frequent crying, even about little things
•Showing too much (or not enough) concern for the baby
•Loss of pleasure or interest in things you used to enjoy
(including sex)

%
 very small number of women (one or two in 1000) suffer a rare and 
severe form of Perinatal Depression called Postpartum Psychosis. 
Women who have a bipolar disorder or other psychiatric problem may 
have a 
higher risk for developing this form of Perinatal Depression. 
Symptoms of Postpartum Psychosis may include:
•Extreme confusion
•Excessive energy and agitation
•Cannot sleep (even when exhausted)
•Rapid and extreme changes in mood
•Distrusting other people
•Seeing things or hearing voices that are not there
•Thoughts of hurting yourself, your baby, or others

Only a trained health care or mental health care provider can tell you 
whether you have Perinatal Depression. However, the following 
checklist can help you know whether you have some of the common 
symptoms. Mark the box if the statement sounds familiar to you.
During the past week or two – 
I have been unable to laugh and see the funny side of things.
I have not looked forward to things I usually enjoy.
I have blamed myself unnecessarily when things went wrong.
I have been anxious or worried for no good reason.
I have felt scared or panicky for no good reason.
Things have been getting the best of me.
I have been so unhappy that I have had difficulty sleeping.
I have felt sad or miserable.
I have been so unhappy that I have been crying.
The thought of harming myself, my baby, or others has occurred to me.

Some women may find it hard talking about Perinatal Depression.  
They may be unsure if they have it or how to discuss it.  They may wish 
to deal with their problem secretly and hope that it goes away on its 
own.
These feelings are more common than one would expect.  However, 
every woman must realize that she is not alone.  Perinatal Depression  
affects thousands of women and can be treated successfully.
